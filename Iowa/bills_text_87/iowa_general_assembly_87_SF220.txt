  1 18    Sec. 2.    1 18    Sec. 2.    1 19 enforcement systems.
  1 20    1.  The department shall not place, operate, maintain,
  1 21 or employ the use of any automated traffic law enforcement
  1 22 system. The department shall not cause to be placed any
  1 23 automated traffic law enforcement system except as provided in
  1 24 this section or in rules adopted by the department under this
  1 25 section.
  1 26    2.  a.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  1 27 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  1 28 enforcement system without approving the use of the system
  1 29 following an established self=certification process. The
  1 30 self=certification process shall include a justification report
  1 31 meeting the requirements of paragraph "b", which shall be
  1 32 made readily available for the public to review, and a public
  1 33 hearing at which the local authority shall provide evidence
  1 34 of a demonstrated safety need for the automated traffic law
  1 35 enforcement system. Notice of the date, time, and place of
  2  1 the hearing shall be published in the manner described in
  2  2 section 362.3. A public hearing may address several locations
  2  3 at which a local authority intends to place an automated
  2  4 traffic law enforcement system. However, a local authority
  2  5 shall adopt an ordinance approving the use of an automated
  2  6 traffic law enforcement system for each location at which the
  2  7 local authority operates a fixed or mobile automated traffic
  2  8 law enforcement system. A local authority may approve the
  2  9 operation of an automated traffic law enforcement system
  2 10 only if the system is located in a documented high=crash or
  2 11 high=risk location at which there is a demonstrated safety
  2 12 need for the system. The local authority shall demonstrate
  2 13 the safety need for the system based on the volume of traffic,
  2 14 the history of motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type
  2 15 of traffic violations, the risk to peace officers employing
  2 16 traditional traffic enforcement methods, any additional
  2 17 information required in the justification report, and any other
  2 18 safety criteria deemed appropriate by the local authority.
  2 19 These requirements shall apply for each location at which a
  2 20 local authority, or another entity on a local authority's
  2 21 behalf, operates a fixed or mobile automated traffic law
  2 22 enforcement system.
  2 23    b.  A justification report shall provide all necessary
  2 24 information and documentation to demonstrate whether an area is
  2 25 a high=crash or high=risk location and shall include but not be
  2 26 limited to documentation regarding all the following:
  2 27    (1)  Existing traffic speeds, posted speed limits,
  2 28 traffic volumes, and intersection or roadway geometry. Such
  2 29 documentation shall provide assurance that existing speed
  2 30 limits and official traffic=control signal timings are
  2 31 appropriate and shall describe how the limits and timings were
  2 32 established.
  2 33    (2)  The applicable motor vehicle accident history, the
  2 34 primary accident types, accident causes, accident severity, and
  2 35 the history of any related traffic violations. Only accidents
  3  1 attributable to violating the speed limit or an official
  3  2 traffic=control signal shall be included in this report. Such
  3  3 documentation shall compare accident data with data from other
  3  4 similar locations within the local authority's jurisdiction,
  3  5 other similar jurisdictions, and larger metropolitan areas.
  3  6    (3)  The identification of critical traffic safety issues
  3  7 related to the data required by subparagraphs (1) and (2),
  3  8 including a comprehensive list of solutions that may address
  3  9 the critical traffic safety issues.
  3 10    (4)  Solutions or safety countermeasures that the local
  3 11 authority has implemented along with those that the local
  3 12 authority has considered but not implemented. These may
  3 13 include solutions relating to law enforcement, engineering,
  3 14 public education campaigns, or other safety countermeasures.
  3 15    (5)  Discussions held and actions taken by the local
  3 16 authority with any partnering entities that have resources
  3 17 which could aid in the reduction of accidents attributable
  3 18 to violating the speed limit or an official traffic=control
  3 19 signal.
  3 20    (6)  The reason or reasons the local authority believes an
  3 21 automated traffic law enforcement system is the best solution
  3 22 to address the critical traffic safety issues.
  3 23    c.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  3 24 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  3 25 enforcement system without posting signage meeting all of the
  3 26 following requirements:
  3 27    (1)  For a fixed automated traffic law enforcement system,
  3 28 permanent signs advising drivers that the system is in place
  3 29 shall be posted in clear and present view of passing drivers in
  3 30 advance of the location where the system is in use.
  3 31    (2)  For a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system,
  3 32 temporary or permanent signs advising drivers that the system
  3 33 is in place shall be posted in clear and present view of
  3 34 passing drivers in advance of the location where the system is
  3 35 in use.
  4  1    (3)  The signage conforms to the manual on uniform
  4  2 traffic=control devices as adopted by the department.
  4  3    d.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  4  4 authority's behalf, shall not issue a citation resulting from
  4  5 the use of an automated traffic law enforcement system until
  4  6 an active peace officer of the local authority has reviewed
  4  7 the citation and any relevant recorded images produced by the
  4  8 system.
  4  9    e.  The amount of the fine or civil penalty imposed by a
  4 10 citation resulting from the use of an automated traffic law
  4 11 enforcement system shall not exceed the amount of the fine for
  4 12 a scheduled violation under section 805.8A for the same or a
  4 13 similar violation of this chapter.
  4 14    f.  An automated traffic law enforcement system working
  4 15 in conjunction with a speed measuring device or official
  4 16 traffic=control signal shall comply with the generally accepted
  4 17 procedures for operating the system. An automated traffic law
  4 18 enforcement system shall verify its internal calibrations on a
  4 19 daily basis. If the daily internal calibration is not valid,
  4 20 the system shall not operate until a successful calibration
  4 21 is subsequently conducted. In addition to the daily internal
  4 22 calibration, a monthly calibration shall be conducted by a
  4 23 person trained in the calibration of the system. A person
  4 24 trained in the calibration of a mobile automated traffic law
  4 25 enforcement system shall also conduct a calibration prior to
  4 26 the use of the mobile system after any change in location.
  4 27 A local authority, or another entity on a local authority's
  4 28 behalf, operating an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 29 system shall maintain a monthly log detailing whether the
  4 30 local authority or entity successfully performed the daily
  4 31 and monthly calibrations. The log and documentation of the
  4 32 calibrations shall be admissible in any court proceeding
  4 33 relating to an official traffic=control signal violation
  4 34 pursuant to section 321.257 or a speed limit violation pursuant
  4 35 to section 321.285.
  5  1    g.  A local authority shall maintain or compile records
  5  2 relating to the number of traffic violations and number
  5  3 of traffic accidents for all locations at which the local
  5  4 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5  5 operates or intends to operate an automated traffic law
  5  6 enforcement system. Such records shall be maintained or
  5  7 compiled by the local authority for one year prior to the
  5  8 installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system
  5  9 and for each year the automated traffic law enforcement
  5 10 system is in operation. Such records shall be available for
  5 11 examination to the same extent allowed in section 22.2.  A
  5 12 local authority with an automated traffic law enforcement
  5 13 system operating within its jurisdiction shall file an annual
  5 14 report with the general assembly on or before December 31 of
  5 15 each year detailing the effectiveness of each automated traffic
  5 16 law enforcement system operating within its jurisdiction. An
  5 17 annual report shall include the justification report described
  5 18 in paragraph "b" and shall also include but not be limited to
  5 19 information relating to increases or decreases in the number of
  5 20 speed limit violations, violations of official traffic=control
  5 21 signals, and traffic accidents.
  5 22    h.  Prior to a local authority placing an automated traffic
  5 23 law enforcement system on a primary road, the local authority
  5 24 shall obtain approval from the department in accordance
  5 25 with rules adopted by the department.  A local authority
  5 26 shall submit to the department any information requested by
  5 27 the department during the approval process.  If the local
  5 28 authority's use of the system is approved by the department,
  5 29 the local authority shall follow the requirements set forth
  5 30 in rules adopted by the department. The department may
  5 31 modify its rules relating to automated traffic law enforcement
  5 32 systems to the extent necessary to ensure automated traffic
  5 33 law enforcement systems are operated in a safe and equitable
  5 34 manner. This paragraph "h" shall not apply to an automated
  5 35 traffic law enforcement system approved or allowed to operate
  6  1 in accordance with rules adopted by the department and in
  6  2 operation prior to January 1, 2017.  A local authority may
  6  3 continue to operate such a system in the same manner as the
  6  4 system was operated prior to January 1, 2017. However, after a
  6  5 local authority discontinues operation of such a system, any
  6  6 new manner of operation or new system operated by the local
  6  7 authority shall comply with this paragraph "h". The department
  6  8 shall have the authority to annually review all automated
  6  9 traffic law enforcement systems placed on primary roads and
  6 10 shall have the authority to require removal or modification of
  6 11 such systems.
  6 12    i.  A local authority shall designate a process by which
  6 13 a person may appeal a citation issued through the use of an
  6 14 automated traffic law enforcement system, which at a minimum
  6 15 shall provide for all of the following:
  6 16    (1)  An appeal to an impartial body created by the local
  6 17 authority to review citations issued through the use of
  6 18 automated traffic law enforcement systems.
  6 19    (2)  Following a decision from the impartial body that is
  6 20 adverse to the person, an appeal to the district court, sitting
  6 21 in small claims, of the county in which the local authority is
  6 22 located.
  6 23    j.  (1)  A local authority shall authorize a petition process
  6 24 by which citizens within the local authority may petition for
  6 25 the removal of a fixed automated traffic law enforcement system
  6 26 or the disapproval of a location approved for the use of mobile
  6 27 automated traffic law enforcement systems in accordance with
  6 28 this section. Petitions under this paragraph "j" shall be
  6 29 specific to one fixed system or one location approved for the
  6 30 use of mobile systems.
  6 31    (2)  If the local authority is a city, a petition brought
  6 32 under this paragraph "j" is valid if it is signed by a number
  6 33 of eligible electors of the city equal to or greater than ten
  6 34 percent of the number of persons who voted in the last regular
  6 35 city election. The petition shall include the signatures of
  7  1 the petitioners, the places of residence of the petitioners,
  7  2 and the date on which the petitioners signed the petition.
  7  3    (3)  If the local authority is a county, a petition brought
  7  4 under this paragraph "j" is valid if it is signed by a number
  7  5 of eligible electors of the county equal to or greater than
  7  6 ten percent of the number of votes cast in the county in the
  7  7 last presidential election. The petition shall include the
  7  8 signatures of the petitioners, the places of residence of the
  7  9 petitioners, and the date on which the petitioners signed the
  7 10 petition.
  7 11    (4)  If a petition is valid as provided in this paragraph
  7 12 "j", the city council or county board of supervisors, as

  1 20    1.  The department shall not place, operate, maintain,
  1 21 or employ the use of any automated traffic law enforcement
  1 22 system. The department shall not cause to be placed any
  1 23 automated traffic law enforcement system except as provided in
  1 24 this section or in rules adopted by the department under this
  1 25 section.
  1 26    2.  a.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  1 27 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  1 28 enforcement system without approving the use of the system
  1 29 following an established self=certification process. The
  1 30 self=certification process shall include a justification report
  1 31 meeting the requirements of paragraph "b", which shall be
  1 32 made readily available for the public to review, and a public
  1 33 hearing at which the local authority shall provide evidence
  1 34 of a demonstrated safety need for the automated traffic law
  1 35 enforcement system. Notice of the date, time, and place of
  2  1 the hearing shall be published in the manner described in
  2  2 section 362.3. A public hearing may address several locations
  2  3 at which a local authority intends to place an automated
  2  4 traffic law enforcement system. However, a local authority
  2  5 shall adopt an ordinance approving the use of an automated
  2  6 traffic law enforcement system for each location at which the
  2  7 local authority operates a fixed or mobile automated traffic
  2  8 law enforcement system. A local authority may approve the
  2  9 operation of an automated traffic law enforcement system
  2 10 only if the system is located in a documented high=crash or
  2 11 high=risk location at which there is a demonstrated safety
  2 12 need for the system. The local authority shall demonstrate
  2 13 the safety need for the system based on the volume of traffic,
  2 14 the history of motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type
  2 15 of traffic violations, the risk to peace officers employing
  2 16 traditional traffic enforcement methods, any additional
  2 17 information required in the justification report, and any other
  2 18 safety criteria deemed appropriate by the local authority.
  2 19 These requirements shall apply for each location at which a
  2 20 local authority, or another entity on a local authority's
  2 21 behalf, operates a fixed or mobile automated traffic law
  2 22 enforcement system.
  2 23    b.  A justification report shall provide all necessary
  2 24 information and documentation to demonstrate whether an area is
  2 25 a high=crash or high=risk location and shall include but not be
  2 26 limited to documentation regarding all the following:
  2 27    (1)  Existing traffic speeds, posted speed limits,
  2 28 traffic volumes, and intersection or roadway geometry. Such
  2 29 documentation shall provide assurance that existing speed
  2 30 limits and official traffic=control signal timings are
  2 31 appropriate and shall describe how the limits and timings were
  2 32 established.
  2 33    (2)  The applicable motor vehicle accident history, the
  2 34 primary accident types, accident causes, accident severity, and
  2 35 the history of any related traffic violations. Only accidents
  3  1 attributable to violating the speed limit or an official
  3  2 traffic=control signal shall be included in this report. Such
  3  3 documentation shall compare accident data with data from other
  3  4 similar locations within the local authority's jurisdiction,
  3  5 other similar jurisdictions, and larger metropolitan areas.
  3  6    (3)  The identification of critical traffic safety issues
  3  7 related to the data required by subparagraphs (1) and (2),
  3  8 including a comprehensive list of solutions that may address
  3  9 the critical traffic safety issues.
  3 10    (4)  Solutions or safety countermeasures that the local
  3 11 authority has implemented along with those that the local
  3 12 authority has considered but not implemented. These may
  3 13 include solutions relating to law enforcement, engineering,
  3 14 public education campaigns, or other safety countermeasures.
  3 15    (5)  Discussions held and actions taken by the local
  3 16 authority with any partnering entities that have resources
  3 17 which could aid in the reduction of accidents attributable
  3 18 to violating the speed limit or an official traffic=control
  3 19 signal.
  3 20    (6)  The reason or reasons the local authority believes an
  3 21 automated traffic law enforcement system is the best solution
  3 22 to address the critical traffic safety issues.
  3 23    c.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  3 24 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  3 25 enforcement system without posting signage meeting all of the
  3 26 following requirements:
  3 27    (1)  For a fixed automated traffic law enforcement system,

  4  2 traffic=control devices as adopted by the department.
  4  3    d.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  4  4 authority's behalf, shall not issue a citation resulting from
  4  5 the use of an automated traffic law enforcement system until
  4  6 an active peace officer of the local authority has reviewed
  4  7 the citation and any relevant recorded images produced by the
  4  8 system.
  4  9    e.  The amount of the fine or civil penalty imposed by a
  4 10 citation resulting from the use of an automated traffic law
  4 11 enforcement system shall not exceed the amount of the fine for
  4 12 a scheduled violation under section 805.8A for the same or a
  4 13 similar violation of this chapter.
  4 14    f.  An automated traffic law enforcement system working
  4 15 in conjunction with a speed measuring device or official
  4 16 traffic=control signal shall comply with the generally accepted
  4 17 procedures for operating the system. An automated traffic law
  4 18 enforcement system shall verify its internal calibrations on a
  4 19 daily basis. If the daily internal calibration is not valid,
  4 20 the system shall not operate until a successful calibration
  4 21 is subsequently conducted. In addition to the daily internal
  4 22 calibration, a monthly calibration shall be conducted by a
  4 23 person trained in the calibration of the system. A person
  4 24 trained in the calibration of a mobile automated traffic law
  4 25 enforcement system shall also conduct a calibration prior to
  4 26 the use of the mobile system after any change in location.
  4 27 A local authority, or another entity on a local authority's
  4 28 behalf, operating an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 29 system shall maintain a monthly log detailing whether the
  4 30 local authority or entity successfully performed the daily
  4 31 and monthly calibrations. The log and documentation of the
  4 32 calibrations shall be admissible in any court proceeding
  4 33 relating to an official traffic=control signal violation
  4 34 pursuant to section 321.257 or a speed limit violation pursuant
  4 35 to section 321.285.
  5  1    g.  A local authority shall maintain or compile records
  5  2 relating to the number of traffic violations and number
  5  3 of traffic accidents for all locations at which the local
  5  4 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5  5 operates or intends to operate an automated traffic law
  5  6 enforcement system. Such records shall be maintained or
  5  7 compiled by the local authority for one year prior to the
  5  8 installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system
  5  9 and for each year the automated traffic law enforcement
  5 10 system is in operation. Such records shall be available for
  5 11 examination to the same extent allowed in section 22.2.  A
  5 12 local authority with an automated traffic law enforcement
  5 13 system operating within its jurisdiction shall file an annual
  5 14 report with the general assembly on or before December 31 of
  5 15 each year detailing the effectiveness of each automated traffic
  5 16 law enforcement system operating within its jurisdiction. An
  5 17 annual report shall include the justification report described
  5 18 in paragraph "b" and shall also include but not be limited to
  5 19 information relating to increases or decreases in the number of
  5 20 speed limit violations, violations of official traffic=control
  5 21 signals, and traffic accidents.

  5 23 law enforcement system on a primary road, the local authority
  5 24 shall obtain approval from the department in accordance
  5 25 with rules adopted by the department.  A local authority
  5 26 shall submit to the department any information requested by
  5 27 the department during the approval process.  If the local
  5 28 authority's use of the system is approved by the department,
  5 29 the local authority shall follow the requirements set forth
  5 30 in rules adopted by the department. The department may
  5 31 modify its rules relating to automated traffic law enforcement
  5 32 systems to the extent necessary to ensure automated traffic
  5 33 law enforcement systems are operated in a safe and equitable
  5 34 manner. This paragraph "h" shall not apply to an automated
  5 35 traffic law enforcement system approved or allowed to operate
  6  1 in accordance with rules adopted by the department and in
  6  2 operation prior to January 1, 2017.  A local authority may
  6  3 continue to operate such a system in the same manner as the
  6  4 system was operated prior to January 1, 2017. However, after a
  6  5 local authority discontinues operation of such a system, any
  6  6 new manner of operation or new system operated by the local
  6  7 authority shall comply with this paragraph "h". The department
  6  8 shall have the authority to annually review all automated

  2 28 traffic volumes, and intersection or roadway geometry. Such
  2 29 documentation shall provide assurance that existing speed
  2 30 limits and official traffic=control signal timings are
  2 31 appropriate and shall describe how the limits and timings were
  2 32 established.
  2 33    (2)  The applicable motor vehicle accident history, the
  2 34 primary accident types, accident causes, accident severity, and
  2 35 the history of any related traffic violations. Only accidents
  3  1 attributable to violating the speed limit or an official
  3  2 traffic=control signal shall be included in this report. Such
  3  3 documentation shall compare accident data with data from other
  3  4 similar locations within the local authority's jurisdiction,
  3  5 other similar jurisdictions, and larger metropolitan areas.
  3  6    (3)  The identification of critical traffic safety issues
  3  7 related to the data required by subparagraphs (1) and (2),
  3  8 including a comprehensive list of solutions that may address
  3  9 the critical traffic safety issues.
  3 10    (4)  Solutions or safety countermeasures that the local
  3 11 authority has implemented along with those that the local
  3 12 authority has considered but not implemented. These may
  3 13 include solutions relating to law enforcement, engineering,
  3 14 public education campaigns, or other safety countermeasures.
  3 15    (5)  Discussions held and actions taken by the local
  3 16 authority with any partnering entities that have resources
  3 17 which could aid in the reduction of accidents attributable
  3 18 to violating the speed limit or an official traffic=control

  3 20    (6)  The reason or reasons the local authority believes an
  3 21 automated traffic law enforcement system is the best solution
  3 22 to address the critical traffic safety issues.
  3 23    c.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  3 24 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  3 25 enforcement system without posting signage meeting all of the
  3 26 following requirements:
  3 27    (1)  For a fixed automated traffic law enforcement system,

  4  6 an active peace officer of the local authority has reviewed
  4  7 the citation and any relevant recorded images produced by the
  4  8 system.
  4  9    e.  The amount of the fine or civil penalty imposed by a
  4 10 citation resulting from the use of an automated traffic law
  4 11 enforcement system shall not exceed the amount of the fine for
  4 12 a scheduled violation under section 805.8A for the same or a
  4 13 similar violation of this chapter.
  4 14    f.  An automated traffic law enforcement system working
  4 15 in conjunction with a speed measuring device or official
  4 16 traffic=control signal shall comply with the generally accepted
  4 17 procedures for operating the system. An automated traffic law
  4 18 enforcement system shall verify its internal calibrations on a
  4 19 daily basis. If the daily internal calibration is not valid,
  4 20 the system shall not operate until a successful calibration
  4 21 is subsequently conducted. In addition to the daily internal
  4 22 calibration, a monthly calibration shall be conducted by a
  4 23 person trained in the calibration of the system. A person
  4 24 trained in the calibration of a mobile automated traffic law
  4 25 enforcement system shall also conduct a calibration prior to
  4 26 the use of the mobile system after any change in location.
  4 27 A local authority, or another entity on a local authority's
  4 28 behalf, operating an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 29 system shall maintain a monthly log detailing whether the
  4 30 local authority or entity successfully performed the daily
  4 31 and monthly calibrations. The log and documentation of the

  4 33 relating to an official traffic=control signal violation
  4 34 pursuant to section 321.257 or a speed limit violation pursuant
  4 35 to section 321.285.
  5  1    g.  A local authority shall maintain or compile records
  5  2 relating to the number of traffic violations and number
  5  3 of traffic accidents for all locations at which the local
  5  4 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5  5 operates or intends to operate an automated traffic law
  5  6 enforcement system. Such records shall be maintained or
  5  7 compiled by the local authority for one year prior to the
  5  8 installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system
  5  9 and for each year the automated traffic law enforcement
  5 10 system is in operation. Such records shall be available for
  5 11 examination to the same extent allowed in section 22.2.  A
  5 12 local authority with an automated traffic law enforcement
  5 13 system operating within its jurisdiction shall file an annual
  5 14 report with the general assembly on or before December 31 of
  5 15 each year detailing the effectiveness of each automated traffic
  5 16 law enforcement system operating within its jurisdiction. An
  5 17 annual report shall include the justification report described
  5 18 in paragraph "b" and shall also include but not be limited to
  5 19 information relating to increases or decreases in the number of
  5 20 speed limit violations, violations of official traffic=control
  5 21 signals, and traffic accidents.
  5 22    h.  Prior to a local authority placing an automated traffic
  5 23 law enforcement system on a primary road, the local authority
  5 24 shall obtain approval from the department in accordance
  5 25 with rules adopted by the department.  A local authority
  5 26 shall submit to the department any information requested by
  5 27 the department during the approval process.  If the local
  5 28 authority's use of the system is approved by the department,
  5 29 the local authority shall follow the requirements set forth
  5 30 in rules adopted by the department. The department may
  5 31 modify its rules relating to automated traffic law enforcement
  5 32 systems to the extent necessary to ensure automated traffic
  5 33 law enforcement systems are operated in a safe and equitable
  5 34 manner. This paragraph "h" shall not apply to an automated
  5 35 traffic law enforcement system approved or allowed to operate
  6  1 in accordance with rules adopted by the department and in
  6  2 operation prior to January 1, 2017.  A local authority may
  6  3 continue to operate such a system in the same manner as the
  6  4 system was operated prior to January 1, 2017. However, after a
  6  5 local authority discontinues operation of such a system, any
  6  6 new manner of operation or new system operated by the local
  6  7 authority shall comply with this paragraph "h". The department
  6  8 shall have the authority to annually review all automated
  6  9 traffic law enforcement systems placed on primary roads and
  6 10 shall have the authority to require removal or modification of
  6 11 such systems.

  1 25 section.
  1 26    2.  a.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  1 27 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  1 28 enforcement system without approving the use of the system
  1 29 following an established self=certification process. The
  1 30 self=certification process shall include a justification report
  1 31 meeting the requirements of paragraph "b", which shall be
  1 32 made readily available for the public to review, and a public
  1 33 hearing at which the local authority shall provide evidence
  1 34 of a demonstrated safety need for the automated traffic law
  1 35 enforcement system. Notice of the date, time, and place of
  2  1 the hearing shall be published in the manner described in
  2  2 section 362.3. A public hearing may address several locations
  2  3 at which a local authority intends to place an automated
  2  4 traffic law enforcement system. However, a local authority
  2  5 shall adopt an ordinance approving the use of an automated
  2  6 traffic law enforcement system for each location at which the
  2  7 local authority operates a fixed or mobile automated traffic
  2  8 law enforcement system. A local authority may approve the
  2  9 operation of an automated traffic law enforcement system
  2 10 only if the system is located in a documented high=crash or
  2 11 high=risk location at which there is a demonstrated safety
  2 12 need for the system. The local authority shall demonstrate
  2 13 the safety need for the system based on the volume of traffic,
  2 14 the history of motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type
  2 15 of traffic violations, the risk to peace officers employing
  2 16 traditional traffic enforcement methods, any additional
  2 17 information required in the justification report, and any other
  2 18 safety criteria deemed appropriate by the local authority.
  2 19 These requirements shall apply for each location at which a
  2 20 local authority, or another entity on a local authority's
  2 21 behalf, operates a fixed or mobile automated traffic law
  2 22 enforcement system.
  2 23    b.  A justification report shall provide all necessary
  2 24 information and documentation to demonstrate whether an area is
  2 25 a high=crash or high=risk location and shall include but not be
  2 26 limited to documentation regarding all the following:
  2 27    (1)  Existing traffic speeds, posted speed limits,
  2 28 traffic volumes, and intersection or roadway geometry. Such
  2 29 documentation shall provide assurance that existing speed
  2 30 limits and official traffic=control signal timings are
  2 31 appropriate and shall describe how the limits and timings were
  2 32 established.
  2 33    (2)  The applicable motor vehicle accident history, the
  2 34 primary accident types, accident causes, accident severity, and
  2 35 the history of any related traffic violations. Only accidents
  3  1 attributable to violating the speed limit or an official
  3  2 traffic=control signal shall be included in this report. Such
  3  3 documentation shall compare accident data with data from other
  3  4 similar locations within the local authority's jurisdiction,
  3  5 other similar jurisdictions, and larger metropolitan areas.
  3  6    (3)  The identification of critical traffic safety issues
  3  7 related to the data required by subparagraphs (1) and (2),
  3  8 including a comprehensive list of solutions that may address
  3  9 the critical traffic safety issues.
  3 10    (4)  Solutions or safety countermeasures that the local
  3 11 authority has implemented along with those that the local
  3 12 authority has considered but not implemented. These may
  3 13 include solutions relating to law enforcement, engineering,
  3 14 public education campaigns, or other safety countermeasures.
  3 15    (5)  Discussions held and actions taken by the local
  3 16 authority with any partnering entities that have resources
  3 17 which could aid in the reduction of accidents attributable
  3 18 to violating the speed limit or an official traffic=control
  3 19 signal.
  3 20    (6)  The reason or reasons the local authority believes an
  3 21 automated traffic law enforcement system is the best solution
  3 22 to address the critical traffic safety issues.
  3 23    c.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  3 24 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  3 25 enforcement system without posting signage meeting all of the
  3 26 following requirements:
  3 27    (1)  For a fixed automated traffic law enforcement system,
  3 28 permanent signs advising drivers that the system is in place
  3 29 shall be posted in clear and present view of passing drivers in
  3 30 advance of the location where the system is in use.
  3 31    (2)  For a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system,
  3 32 temporary or permanent signs advising drivers that the system
  3 33 is in place shall be posted in clear and present view of
  3 34 passing drivers in advance of the location where the system is
  3 35 in use.

  4  2 traffic=control devices as adopted by the department.
  4  3    d.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  4  4 authority's behalf, shall not issue a citation resulting from
  4  5 the use of an automated traffic law enforcement system until
  4  6 an active peace officer of the local authority has reviewed
  4  7 the citation and any relevant recorded images produced by the
  4  8 system.
  4  9    e.  The amount of the fine or civil penalty imposed by a
  4 10 citation resulting from the use of an automated traffic law
  4 11 enforcement system shall not exceed the amount of the fine for
  4 12 a scheduled violation under section 805.8A for the same or a
  4 13 similar violation of this chapter.
  4 14    f.  An automated traffic law enforcement system working
  4 15 in conjunction with a speed measuring device or official
  4 16 traffic=control signal shall comply with the generally accepted
  4 17 procedures for operating the system. An automated traffic law
  4 18 enforcement system shall verify its internal calibrations on a
  4 19 daily basis. If the daily internal calibration is not valid,
  4 20 the system shall not operate until a successful calibration
  4 21 is subsequently conducted. In addition to the daily internal
  4 22 calibration, a monthly calibration shall be conducted by a
  4 23 person trained in the calibration of the system. A person
  4 24 trained in the calibration of a mobile automated traffic law
  4 25 enforcement system shall also conduct a calibration prior to
  4 26 the use of the mobile system after any change in location.
  4 27 A local authority, or another entity on a local authority's
  4 28 behalf, operating an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 29 system shall maintain a monthly log detailing whether the
  4 30 local authority or entity successfully performed the daily
  4 31 and monthly calibrations. The log and documentation of the
  4 32 calibrations shall be admissible in any court proceeding
  4 33 relating to an official traffic=control signal violation
  4 34 pursuant to section 321.257 or a speed limit violation pursuant
  4 35 to section 321.285.
  5  1    g.  A local authority shall maintain or compile records
  5  2 relating to the number of traffic violations and number
  5  3 of traffic accidents for all locations at which the local
  5  4 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5  5 operates or intends to operate an automated traffic law
  5  6 enforcement system. Such records shall be maintained or
  5  7 compiled by the local authority for one year prior to the
  5  8 installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system
  5  9 and for each year the automated traffic law enforcement
  5 10 system is in operation. Such records shall be available for
  5 11 examination to the same extent allowed in section 22.2.  A
  5 12 local authority with an automated traffic law enforcement
  5 13 system operating within its jurisdiction shall file an annual
  5 14 report with the general assembly on or before December 31 of
  5 15 each year detailing the effectiveness of each automated traffic
  5 16 law enforcement system operating within its jurisdiction. An
  5 17 annual report shall include the justification report described
  5 18 in paragraph "b" and shall also include but not be limited to
  5 19 information relating to increases or decreases in the number of
  5 20 speed limit violations, violations of official traffic=control
  5 21 signals, and traffic accidents.
  5 22    h.  Prior to a local authority placing an automated traffic
  5 23 law enforcement system on a primary road, the local authority
  5 24 shall obtain approval from the department in accordance
  5 25 with rules adopted by the department.  A local authority
  5 26 shall submit to the department any information requested by
  5 27 the department during the approval process.  If the local
  5 28 authority's use of the system is approved by the department,
  5 29 the local authority shall follow the requirements set forth
  5 30 in rules adopted by the department. The department may
  5 31 modify its rules relating to automated traffic law enforcement
  5 32 systems to the extent necessary to ensure automated traffic
  5 33 law enforcement systems are operated in a safe and equitable
  5 34 manner. This paragraph "h" shall not apply to an automated
  5 35 traffic law enforcement system approved or allowed to operate

  5  3 of traffic accidents for all locations at which the local
  5  4 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5  5 operates or intends to operate an automated traffic law
  5  6 enforcement system. Such records shall be maintained or
  5  7 compiled by the local authority for one year prior to the
  5  8 installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system
  5  9 and for each year the automated traffic law enforcement
  5 10 system is in operation. Such records shall be available for
  5 11 examination to the same extent allowed in section 22.2.  A
  5 12 local authority with an automated traffic law enforcement
  5 13 system operating within its jurisdiction shall file an annual
  5 14 report with the general assembly on or before December 31 of
  5 15 each year detailing the effectiveness of each automated traffic
  5 16 law enforcement system operating within its jurisdiction. An
  5 17 annual report shall include the justification report described
  5 18 in paragraph "b" and shall also include but not be limited to
  5 19 information relating to increases or decreases in the number of
  5 20 speed limit violations, violations of official traffic=control
  5 21 signals, and traffic accidents.
  5 22    h.  Prior to a local authority placing an automated traffic
  5 23 law enforcement system on a primary road, the local authority
  5 24 shall obtain approval from the department in accordance
  5 25 with rules adopted by the department.  A local authority
  5 26 shall submit to the department any information requested by
  5 27 the department during the approval process.  If the local
  5 28 authority's use of the system is approved by the department,
  5 29 the local authority shall follow the requirements set forth
  5 30 in rules adopted by the department. The department may
  5 31 modify its rules relating to automated traffic law enforcement
  5 32 systems to the extent necessary to ensure automated traffic
  5 33 law enforcement systems are operated in a safe and equitable
  5 34 manner. This paragraph "h" shall not apply to an automated
  5 35 traffic law enforcement system approved or allowed to operate
  6  1 in accordance with rules adopted by the department and in
  6  2 operation prior to January 1, 2017.  A local authority may
  6  3 continue to operate such a system in the same manner as the
  6  4 system was operated prior to January 1, 2017. However, after a
  6  5 local authority discontinues operation of such a system, any
  6  6 new manner of operation or new system operated by the local
  6  7 authority shall comply with this paragraph "h". The department
  6  8 shall have the authority to annually review all automated
  6  9 traffic law enforcement systems placed on primary roads and
  6 10 shall have the authority to require removal or modification of
  6 11 such systems.
  6 12    i.  A local authority shall designate a process by which
  6 13 a person may appeal a citation issued through the use of an
  6 14 automated traffic law enforcement system, which at a minimum
  6 15 shall provide for all of the following:
  6 16    (1)  An appeal to an impartial body created by the local
  6 17 authority to review citations issued through the use of
  6 18 automated traffic law enforcement systems.
  6 19    (2)  Following a decision from the impartial body that is
  6 20 adverse to the person, an appeal to the district court, sitting
  6 21 in small claims, of the county in which the local authority is
  6 22 located.
  6 23    j.  (1)  A local authority shall authorize a petition process
  6 24 by which citizens within the local authority may petition for
  6 25 the removal of a fixed automated traffic law enforcement system
  6 26 or the disapproval of a location approved for the use of mobile
  6 27 automated traffic law enforcement systems in accordance with
  6 28 this section. Petitions under this paragraph "j" shall be
  6 29 specific to one fixed system or one location approved for the
  6 30 use of mobile systems.
  6 31    (2)  If the local authority is a city, a petition brought
  6 32 under this paragraph "j" is valid if it is signed by a number
  6 33 of eligible electors of the city equal to or greater than ten
  6 34 percent of the number of persons who voted in the last regular
  6 35 city election. The petition shall include the signatures of
  7  1 the petitioners, the places of residence of the petitioners,
  7  2 and the date on which the petitioners signed the petition.
  7  3    (3)  If the local authority is a county, a petition brought
  7  4 under this paragraph "j" is valid if it is signed by a number
  7  5 of eligible electors of the county equal to or greater than
  7  6 ten percent of the number of votes cast in the county in the
  7  7 last presidential election. The petition shall include the
  7  8 signatures of the petitioners, the places of residence of the
  7  9 petitioners, and the date on which the petitioners signed the
  7 10 petition.
  7 11    (4)  If a petition is valid as provided in this paragraph
  7 12 "j", the city council or county board of supervisors, as
  7 13 applicable, shall vote on whether to repeal the ordinance
  7 14 allowing the operation of the fixed system or approving the
  7 15 location for the use of mobile systems.
  7 16    (5)  If a city council or county board of supervisors has
  7 17 voted pursuant to subparagraph (4), a new petition for the same
  7 18 fixed system or the same location approved for use of mobile
  7 19 systems shall not be valid for three years after the date of
  7 20 the vote.
  7 21    k.  A local authority that operates an automated traffic
  7 22 law enforcement system in violation of this section shall be
  7 23 precluded from operating any automated traffic law enforcement
  7 24 system for a period of two years.  A citizen residing within
  7 25 the jurisdiction of a local authority which violates this
  7 26 section shall be allowed to file suit to enjoin the local
  7 27 authority from operating an automated traffic law enforcement
  7 28 system in accordance with this paragraph "k".
  7 29    3.  All moneys collected by a local authority from citations
  7 30 issued as a result of the use of an automated traffic law
  7 31 enforcement system, less the amount necessary for the
  7 32 installation, operation, and maintenance of the automated
  7 33 traffic law enforcement system, shall be deposited in the
  7 34 account or accounts maintained by the local authority for
  7 35 moneys appropriated to the local authority from the secondary
  8  1 road fund or street construction fund of the cities, or shall
  8  2 be deposited in any account and used for the purposes of public
  8  3 safety. This subsection shall not apply to moneys collected
  8  4 for court costs or other associated costs, the criminal penalty
  8  5 surcharge required by section 911.1, or the county enforcement
  8  6 surcharge required by section 911.4, as applicable.

  1 26    2.  a.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  1 27 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  1 28 enforcement system without approving the use of the system
  1 29 following an established self=certification process. The
  1 30 self=certification process shall include a justification report
  1 31 meeting the requirements of paragraph "b", which shall be
  1 32 made readily available for the public to review, and a public
  1 33 hearing at which the local authority shall provide evidence
  1 34 of a demonstrated safety need for the automated traffic law
  1 35 enforcement system. Notice of the date, time, and place of
  2  1 the hearing shall be published in the manner described in
  2  2 section 362.3. A public hearing may address several locations
  2  3 at which a local authority intends to place an automated
  2  4 traffic law enforcement system. However, a local authority
  2  5 shall adopt an ordinance approving the use of an automated
  2  6 traffic law enforcement system for each location at which the
  2  7 local authority operates a fixed or mobile automated traffic
  2  8 law enforcement system. A local authority may approve the
  2  9 operation of an automated traffic law enforcement system
  2 10 only if the system is located in a documented high=crash or
  2 11 high=risk location at which there is a demonstrated safety
  2 12 need for the system. The local authority shall demonstrate
  2 13 the safety need for the system based on the volume of traffic,
  2 14 the history of motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type
  2 15 of traffic violations, the risk to peace officers employing
  2 16 traditional traffic enforcement methods, any additional
  2 17 information required in the justification report, and any other
  2 18 safety criteria deemed appropriate by the local authority.
  2 19 These requirements shall apply for each location at which a
  2 20 local authority, or another entity on a local authority's
  2 21 behalf, operates a fixed or mobile automated traffic law
  2 22 enforcement system.
  2 23    b.  A justification report shall provide all necessary
  2 24 information and documentation to demonstrate whether an area is
  2 25 a high=crash or high=risk location and shall include but not be
  2 26 limited to documentation regarding all the following:
  2 27    (1)  Existing traffic speeds, posted speed limits,
  2 28 traffic volumes, and intersection or roadway geometry. Such
  2 29 documentation shall provide assurance that existing speed
  2 30 limits and official traffic=control signal timings are
  2 31 appropriate and shall describe how the limits and timings were
  2 32 established.
  2 33    (2)  The applicable motor vehicle accident history, the
  2 34 primary accident types, accident causes, accident severity, and
  2 35 the history of any related traffic violations. Only accidents
  3  1 attributable to violating the speed limit or an official
  3  2 traffic=control signal shall be included in this report. Such
  3  3 documentation shall compare accident data with data from other
  3  4 similar locations within the local authority's jurisdiction,
  3  5 other similar jurisdictions, and larger metropolitan areas.
  3  6    (3)  The identification of critical traffic safety issues
  3  7 related to the data required by subparagraphs (1) and (2),
  3  8 including a comprehensive list of solutions that may address
  3  9 the critical traffic safety issues.
  3 10    (4)  Solutions or safety countermeasures that the local
  3 11 authority has implemented along with those that the local
  3 12 authority has considered but not implemented. These may
  3 13 include solutions relating to law enforcement, engineering,
  3 14 public education campaigns, or other safety countermeasures.
  3 15    (5)  Discussions held and actions taken by the local
  3 16 authority with any partnering entities that have resources
  3 17 which could aid in the reduction of accidents attributable
  3 18 to violating the speed limit or an official traffic=control
  3 19 signal.
  3 20    (6)  The reason or reasons the local authority believes an
  3 21 automated traffic law enforcement system is the best solution
  3 22 to address the critical traffic safety issues.
  3 23    c.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  3 24 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  3 25 enforcement system without posting signage meeting all of the
  3 26 following requirements:
  3 27    (1)  For a fixed automated traffic law enforcement system,
  3 28 permanent signs advising drivers that the system is in place
  3 29 shall be posted in clear and present view of passing drivers in
  3 30 advance of the location where the system is in use.
  3 31    (2)  For a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system,
  3 32 temporary or permanent signs advising drivers that the system
  3 33 is in place shall be posted in clear and present view of
  3 34 passing drivers in advance of the location where the system is
  3 35 in use.
  4  1    (3)  The signage conforms to the manual on uniform
  4  2 traffic=control devices as adopted by the department.
  4  3    d.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  4  4 authority's behalf, shall not issue a citation resulting from
  4  5 the use of an automated traffic law enforcement system until
  4  6 an active peace officer of the local authority has reviewed
  4  7 the citation and any relevant recorded images produced by the
  4  8 system.
  4  9    e.  The amount of the fine or civil penalty imposed by a
  4 10 citation resulting from the use of an automated traffic law
  4 11 enforcement system shall not exceed the amount of the fine for
  4 12 a scheduled violation under section 805.8A for the same or a
  4 13 similar violation of this chapter.
  4 14    f.  An automated traffic law enforcement system working
  4 15 in conjunction with a speed measuring device or official
  4 16 traffic=control signal shall comply with the generally accepted
  4 17 procedures for operating the system. An automated traffic law
  4 18 enforcement system shall verify its internal calibrations on a
  4 19 daily basis. If the daily internal calibration is not valid,
  4 20 the system shall not operate until a successful calibration
  4 21 is subsequently conducted. In addition to the daily internal
  4 22 calibration, a monthly calibration shall be conducted by a
  4 23 person trained in the calibration of the system. A person
  4 24 trained in the calibration of a mobile automated traffic law
  4 25 enforcement system shall also conduct a calibration prior to
  4 26 the use of the mobile system after any change in location.
  4 27 A local authority, or another entity on a local authority's
  4 28 behalf, operating an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 29 system shall maintain a monthly log detailing whether the
  4 30 local authority or entity successfully performed the daily
  4 31 and monthly calibrations. The log and documentation of the
  4 32 calibrations shall be admissible in any court proceeding
  4 33 relating to an official traffic=control signal violation
  4 34 pursuant to section 321.257 or a speed limit violation pursuant
  4 35 to section 321.285.
  5  1    g.  A local authority shall maintain or compile records
  5  2 relating to the number of traffic violations and number

  5  4 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5  5 operates or intends to operate an automated traffic law
  5  6 enforcement system. Such records shall be maintained or
  5  7 compiled by the local authority for one year prior to the
  5  8 installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system
  5  9 and for each year the automated traffic law enforcement
  5 10 system is in operation. Such records shall be available for
  5 11 examination to the same extent allowed in section 22.2.  A
  5 12 local authority with an automated traffic law enforcement
  5 13 system operating within its jurisdiction shall file an annual
  5 14 report with the general assembly on or before December 31 of
  5 15 each year detailing the effectiveness of each automated traffic
  5 16 law enforcement system operating within its jurisdiction. An
  5 17 annual report shall include the justification report described
  5 18 in paragraph "b" and shall also include but not be limited to
  5 19 information relating to increases or decreases in the number of
  5 20 speed limit violations, violations of official traffic=control
  5 21 signals, and traffic accidents.

  5 23 law enforcement system on a primary road, the local authority
  5 24 shall obtain approval from the department in accordance
  5 25 with rules adopted by the department.  A local authority
  5 26 shall submit to the department any information requested by
  5 27 the department during the approval process.  If the local
  5 28 authority's use of the system is approved by the department,
  5 29 the local authority shall follow the requirements set forth
  5 30 in rules adopted by the department. The department may
  5 31 modify its rules relating to automated traffic law enforcement
  5 32 systems to the extent necessary to ensure automated traffic
  5 33 law enforcement systems are operated in a safe and equitable
  5 34 manner. This paragraph "h" shall not apply to an automated
  5 35 traffic law enforcement system approved or allowed to operate

  4 19 daily basis. If the daily internal calibration is not valid,
  4 20 the system shall not operate until a successful calibration
  4 21 is subsequently conducted. In addition to the daily internal
  4 22 calibration, a monthly calibration shall be conducted by a
  4 23 person trained in the calibration of the system. A person
  4 24 trained in the calibration of a mobile automated traffic law
  4 25 enforcement system shall also conduct a calibration prior to
  4 26 the use of the mobile system after any change in location.
  4 27 A local authority, or another entity on a local authority's
  4 28 behalf, operating an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 29 system shall maintain a monthly log detailing whether the
  4 30 local authority or entity successfully performed the daily
  4 31 and monthly calibrations. The log and documentation of the
  4 32 calibrations shall be admissible in any court proceeding
  4 33 relating to an official traffic=control signal violation
  4 34 pursuant to section 321.257 or a speed limit violation pursuant
  4 35 to section 321.285.
  5  1    g.  A local authority shall maintain or compile records
  5  2 relating to the number of traffic violations and number
  5  3 of traffic accidents for all locations at which the local
  5  4 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5  5 operates or intends to operate an automated traffic law
  5  6 enforcement system. Such records shall be maintained or
  5  7 compiled by the local authority for one year prior to the
  5  8 installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system
  5  9 and for each year the automated traffic law enforcement
  5 10 system is in operation. Such records shall be available for
  5 11 examination to the same extent allowed in section 22.2.  A
  5 12 local authority with an automated traffic law enforcement
  5 13 system operating within its jurisdiction shall file an annual
  5 14 report with the general assembly on or before December 31 of
  5 15 each year detailing the effectiveness of each automated traffic
  5 16 law enforcement system operating within its jurisdiction. An
  5 17 annual report shall include the justification report described
  5 18 in paragraph "b" and shall also include but not be limited to
  5 19 information relating to increases or decreases in the number of
  5 20 speed limit violations, violations of official traffic=control
  5 21 signals, and traffic accidents.
  5 22    h.  Prior to a local authority placing an automated traffic
  5 23 law enforcement system on a primary road, the local authority
  5 24 shall obtain approval from the department in accordance
  5 25 with rules adopted by the department.  A local authority
  5 26 shall submit to the department any information requested by
  5 27 the department during the approval process.  If the local
  5 28 authority's use of the system is approved by the department,
  5 29 the local authority shall follow the requirements set forth
  5 30 in rules adopted by the department. The department may
  5 31 modify its rules relating to automated traffic law enforcement
  5 32 systems to the extent necessary to ensure automated traffic
  5 33 law enforcement systems are operated in a safe and equitable
  5 34 manner. This paragraph "h" shall not apply to an automated
  5 35 traffic law enforcement system approved or allowed to operate
  6  1 in accordance with rules adopted by the department and in
  6  2 operation prior to January 1, 2017.  A local authority may
  6  3 continue to operate such a system in the same manner as the
  6  4 system was operated prior to January 1, 2017. However, after a
  6  5 local authority discontinues operation of such a system, any
  6  6 new manner of operation or new system operated by the local
  6  7 authority shall comply with this paragraph "h". The department
  6  8 shall have the authority to annually review all automated
  6  9 traffic law enforcement systems placed on primary roads and
  6 10 shall have the authority to require removal or modification of
  6 11 such systems.

  3 18 to violating the speed limit or an official traffic=control
  3 19 signal.
  3 20    (6)  The reason or reasons the local authority believes an
  3 21 automated traffic law enforcement system is the best solution
  3 22 to address the critical traffic safety issues.
  3 23    c.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  3 24 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  3 25 enforcement system without posting signage meeting all of the
  3 26 following requirements:
  3 27    (1)  For a fixed automated traffic law enforcement system,
  3 28 permanent signs advising drivers that the system is in place
  3 29 shall be posted in clear and present view of passing drivers in
  3 30 advance of the location where the system is in use.
  3 31    (2)  For a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system,
  3 32 temporary or permanent signs advising drivers that the system
  3 33 is in place shall be posted in clear and present view of
  3 34 passing drivers in advance of the location where the system is
  3 35 in use.
  4  1    (3)  The signage conforms to the manual on uniform

  5  1    g.  A local authority shall maintain or compile records
  5  2 relating to the number of traffic violations and number
  5  3 of traffic accidents for all locations at which the local
  5  4 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5  5 operates or intends to operate an automated traffic law
  5  6 enforcement system. Such records shall be maintained or
  5  7 compiled by the local authority for one year prior to the
  5  8 installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system
  5  9 and for each year the automated traffic law enforcement
  5 10 system is in operation. Such records shall be available for
  5 11 examination to the same extent allowed in section 22.2.  A
  5 12 local authority with an automated traffic law enforcement
  5 13 system operating within its jurisdiction shall file an annual
  5 14 report with the general assembly on or before December 31 of
  5 15 each year detailing the effectiveness of each automated traffic
  5 16 law enforcement system operating within its jurisdiction. An
  5 17 annual report shall include the justification report described
  5 18 in paragraph "b" and shall also include but not be limited to
  5 19 information relating to increases or decreases in the number of
  5 20 speed limit violations, violations of official traffic=control
  5 21 signals, and traffic accidents.

  5 23 law enforcement system on a primary road, the local authority
  5 24 shall obtain approval from the department in accordance
  5 25 with rules adopted by the department.  A local authority
  5 26 shall submit to the department any information requested by
  5 27 the department during the approval process.  If the local
  5 28 authority's use of the system is approved by the department,
  5 29 the local authority shall follow the requirements set forth
  5 30 in rules adopted by the department. The department may
  5 31 modify its rules relating to automated traffic law enforcement
  5 32 systems to the extent necessary to ensure automated traffic
  5 33 law enforcement systems are operated in a safe and equitable
  5 34 manner. This paragraph "h" shall not apply to an automated
  5 35 traffic law enforcement system approved or allowed to operate
  6  1 in accordance with rules adopted by the department and in
  6  2 operation prior to January 1, 2017.  A local authority may
  6  3 continue to operate such a system in the same manner as the
  6  4 system was operated prior to January 1, 2017. However, after a
  6  5 local authority discontinues operation of such a system, any
  6  6 new manner of operation or new system operated by the local
  6  7 authority shall comply with this paragraph "h". The department
  6  8 shall have the authority to annually review all automated
  6  9 traffic law enforcement systems placed on primary roads and
  6 10 shall have the authority to require removal or modification of
  6 11 such systems.

  6 17 authority to review citations issued through the use of
  6 18 automated traffic law enforcement systems.
  6 19    (2)  Following a decision from the impartial body that is
  6 20 adverse to the person, an appeal to the district court, sitting
  6 21 in small claims, of the county in which the local authority is
  6 22 located.
  6 23    j.  (1)  A local authority shall authorize a petition process
  6 24 by which citizens within the local authority may petition for
  6 25 the removal of a fixed automated traffic law enforcement system
  6 26 or the disapproval of a location approved for the use of mobile
  6 27 automated traffic law enforcement systems in accordance with
  6 28 this section. Petitions under this paragraph "j" shall be
  6 29 specific to one fixed system or one location approved for the
  6 30 use of mobile systems.
  6 31    (2)  If the local authority is a city, a petition brought
  6 32 under this paragraph "j" is valid if it is signed by a number
  6 33 of eligible electors of the city equal to or greater than ten
  6 34 percent of the number of persons who voted in the last regular
  6 35 city election. The petition shall include the signatures of
  7  1 the petitioners, the places of residence of the petitioners,
  7  2 and the date on which the petitioners signed the petition.
  7  3    (3)  If the local authority is a county, a petition brought

  7 19 systems shall not be valid for three years after the date of
  7 20 the vote.
  7 21    k.  A local authority that operates an automated traffic
  7 22 law enforcement system in violation of this section shall be
  7 23 precluded from operating any automated traffic law enforcement
  7 24 system for a period of two years.  A citizen residing within
  7 25 the jurisdiction of a local authority which violates this
  7 26 section shall be allowed to file suit to enjoin the local
  7 27 authority from operating an automated traffic law enforcement
  7 28 system in accordance with this paragraph "k".
  7 29    3.  All moneys collected by a local authority from citations
  7 30 issued as a result of the use of an automated traffic law
  7 31 enforcement system, less the amount necessary for the
  7 32 installation, operation, and maintenance of the automated
  7 33 traffic law enforcement system, shall be deposited in the

  5  1    g.  A local authority shall maintain or compile records
  5  2 relating to the number of traffic violations and number
  5  3 of traffic accidents for all locations at which the local
  5  4 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5  5 operates or intends to operate an automated traffic law
  5  6 enforcement system. Such records shall be maintained or
  5  7 compiled by the local authority for one year prior to the
  5  8 installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system
  5  9 and for each year the automated traffic law enforcement
  5 10 system is in operation. Such records shall be available for
  5 11 examination to the same extent allowed in section 22.2.  A
  5 12 local authority with an automated traffic law enforcement
  5 13 system operating within its jurisdiction shall file an annual
  5 14 report with the general assembly on or before December 31 of
  5 15 each year detailing the effectiveness of each automated traffic
  5 16 law enforcement system operating within its jurisdiction. An
  5 17 annual report shall include the justification report described
  5 18 in paragraph "b" and shall also include but not be limited to
  5 19 information relating to increases or decreases in the number of
  5 20 speed limit violations, violations of official traffic=control
  5 21 signals, and traffic accidents.

  5 30 in rules adopted by the department. The department may
  5 31 modify its rules relating to automated traffic law enforcement
  5 32 systems to the extent necessary to ensure automated traffic
  5 33 law enforcement systems are operated in a safe and equitable
  5 34 manner. This paragraph "h" shall not apply to an automated
  5 35 traffic law enforcement system approved or allowed to operate
  6  1 in accordance with rules adopted by the department and in
  6  2 operation prior to January 1, 2017.  A local authority may
  6  3 continue to operate such a system in the same manner as the
  6  4 system was operated prior to January 1, 2017. However, after a
  6  5 local authority discontinues operation of such a system, any
  6  6 new manner of operation or new system operated by the local
  6  7 authority shall comply with this paragraph "h". The department
  6  8 shall have the authority to annually review all automated

  6 20 adverse to the person, an appeal to the district court, sitting
  6 21 in small claims, of the county in which the local authority is
  6 22 located.
  6 23    j.  (1)  A local authority shall authorize a petition process
  6 24 by which citizens within the local authority may petition for
  6 25 the removal of a fixed automated traffic law enforcement system
  6 26 or the disapproval of a location approved for the use of mobile
  6 27 automated traffic law enforcement systems in accordance with
  6 28 this section. Petitions under this paragraph "j" shall be
  6 29 specific to one fixed system or one location approved for the
  6 30 use of mobile systems.
  6 31    (2)  If the local authority is a city, a petition brought
  6 32 under this paragraph "j" is valid if it is signed by a number
  6 33 of eligible electors of the city equal to or greater than ten
  6 34 percent of the number of persons who voted in the last regular
  6 35 city election. The petition shall include the signatures of
  7  1 the petitioners, the places of residence of the petitioners,
  7  2 and the date on which the petitioners signed the petition.
  7  3    (3)  If the local authority is a county, a petition brought

  5  8 installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system
  5  9 and for each year the automated traffic law enforcement
  5 10 system is in operation. Such records shall be available for
  5 11 examination to the same extent allowed in section 22.2.  A
  5 12 local authority with an automated traffic law enforcement
  5 13 system operating within its jurisdiction shall file an annual
  5 14 report with the general assembly on or before December 31 of
  5 15 each year detailing the effectiveness of each automated traffic
  5 16 law enforcement system operating within its jurisdiction. An
  5 17 annual report shall include the justification report described
  5 18 in paragraph "b" and shall also include but not be limited to
