  5 30                           EXPLANATION
  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a

  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The

  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from

  5 30                           EXPLANATION
  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.

  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as

  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.

  5 30                           EXPLANATION
  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to
  7 26 provide for the  creation of a regional water authority board
  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.
  8 20    All population determinations under the bill are required to
  8 21 be based upon the most recent federal decennial census.
  8 22    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to
  7 26 provide for the  creation of a regional water authority board
  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.

  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of

  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such

  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.

  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to

  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for

  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as

  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional

  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.

  5 30                           EXPLANATION
  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to
  7 26 provide for the  creation of a regional water authority board
  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.
  8 20    All population determinations under the bill are required to
  8 21 be based upon the most recent federal decennial census.
  8 22    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 30                           EXPLANATION
  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to
  7 26 provide for the  creation of a regional water authority board
  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.
  8 20    All population determinations under the bill are required to
  8 21 be based upon the most recent federal decennial census.
  8 22    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 30                           EXPLANATION
  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to
  7 26 provide for the  creation of a regional water authority board
  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.
  8 20    All population determinations under the bill are required to
  8 21 be based upon the most recent federal decennial census.

  4 24    (4)  If the receiving cities cannot agree on the composition
  4 25 of and the proportional representation on the regional water
  4 26 authority board, the matters on which they differ shall be
  4 27 decided by disinterested arbitrators utilizing the criteria
  4 28 provided in subparagraphs (1) through (3), one selected by each

  5  1 within twenty days after the decision is filed.  The appeal
  5  2 shall be tried in equity and a decree entered determining the

  5 30                           EXPLANATION
  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to
  7 26 provide for the  creation of a regional water authority board
  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.
  8 20    All population determinations under the bill are required to
  8 21 be based upon the most recent federal decennial census.

  5 30                           EXPLANATION
  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to
  7 26 provide for the  creation of a regional water authority board
  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.
  8 20    All population determinations under the bill are required to
  8 21 be based upon the most recent federal decennial census.

  5  7 and liabilities from each city under subsection 1 to the
  5  8 regional water authority.

  5 10 board with the same powers and duties of a city utility under
  5 11 chapter 388, and may provide the regional water authority board
  5 12 with additional powers and duties.
  5 13    5.  The agreement shall provide that other cities that are
  5 14 not receiving cities may join the regional water authority
  5 15 under terms specified in the agreement creating the regional
  5 16 water authority, with proportional representation based
  5 17 upon the criteria identified in section 389.6, subsection 2,
  5 18 paragraph "b".
  5 19    6.  A regional water authority shall not expend any moneys or

  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.

  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to
  7 26 provide for the  creation of a regional water authority board
  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.
  8 20    All population determinations under the bill are required to
  8 21 be based upon the most recent federal decennial census.

  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than

  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a

  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a

  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of

  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the

  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.

  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than

  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of

  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,

  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:

  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of

  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to

  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional

  5 30                           EXPLANATION
  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to
  7 26 provide for the  creation of a regional water authority board
  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.
  8 20    All population determinations under the bill are required to

  5 16 water authority, with proportional representation based
  5 17 upon the criteria identified in section 389.6, subsection 2,
  5 18 paragraph "b".
  5 19    6.  A regional water authority shall not expend any moneys or

  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the

  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to
  7 26 provide for the  creation of a regional water authority board
  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.
  8 20    All population determinations under the bill are required to
  8 21 be based upon the most recent federal decennial census.
  8 22    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 10 board with the same powers and duties of a city utility under
  5 11 chapter 388, and may provide the regional water authority board
  5 12 with additional powers and duties.
  5 13    5.  The agreement shall provide that other cities that are
  5 14 not receiving cities may join the regional water authority
  5 15 under terms specified in the agreement creating the regional
  5 16 water authority, with proportional representation based
  5 17 upon the criteria identified in section 389.6, subsection 2,
  5 18 paragraph "b".
  5 19    6.  A regional water authority shall not expend any moneys or
  5 20 staff time to plan, design, or construct any new water plant or
  5 21 other water=producing facility before July 1, 2018.

  5 25    Sec. 6.  CODE EDITOR.  The Code editor shall codify sections
  5 26 389.1 through 389.5 as subchapter I, and section 389.6 as
  5 27 enacted by this Act as subchapter II of chapter 389.

  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of

  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a

  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a

  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide

  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes

  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than

  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of

  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing

  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as

  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to
  7 26 provide for the  creation of a regional water authority board
  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.

  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than

  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such

  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the

  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a

  5 30                           EXPLANATION
  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:

  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide

  5 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 33    This bill provides for the creation of a regional water
  5 34 authority and regional water authority board to assume the
  5 35 transfer of powers, duties, assets, and liabilities of a water
  6  1 utility.
  6  2    Under the bill, the boards of certain city water utilities
  6  3 are discontinued. The only utilities impacted under the bill
  6  4 are those that provide water services and that are located
  6  5 in a federally designated standard metropolitan statistical
  6  6 area located entirely within the state and have populations
  6  7 greater than 500,000. The bill requires that the water
  6  8 utility's powers, duties, assets, and liabilities be separately
  6  9 transferred to each city in which the utility's main water
  6 10 production is located that has a population greater than
  6 11 39,000.
  6 12    The board of the water utility is required, by resolution, to
  6 13 provide for the equitable transfer of the assets, and equitable
  6 14 transfer and assumption of the liabilities and powers and
  6 15 duties, of the utility to allow for the continued provision of
  6 16 water services to customers. The transfers are completed upon
  6 17 the agreement, by resolution, of each city council receiving
  6 18 assets, liabilities, or responsibilities under the bill. The
  6 19 bill requires that if a city council cannot agree on such
  6 20 distributions and assumptions with the associated board, the
  6 21 matters on which they differ must be decided by disinterested
  6 22 arbitrators, one selected by the board of the water utility,
  6 23 one selected by the city council that fails to agree to the
  6 24 transfers and assumptions, and one selected by the mayor of the
  6 25 city who appointed the members of the board. The bill provides
  6 26 that the decision of the arbitrators shall be made in writing
  6 27 and filed with the board, and allows a party to the proceedings
  6 28 to appeal the decision to the district court, with the appeal
  6 29 tried in equity and a decree entered determining the entire
  6 30 matter.
  6 31    The bill requires that the city manager employed by the
  6 32 city council that set the compensation of the members of the
  6 33 discontinued water utility  designate the administrator of a
  6 34 department or administrative division of that city, meeting
  6 35 certain other qualifications, to be the manager of the water
  7  1 supply system until the establishment or designation of a
  7  2 regional water authority and subject to the approval of the
  7  3 city council.
  7  4    The bill prohibits a water utility and any city receiving
  7  5 powers, duties, assets, or liabilities from the water utility
  7  6 from expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design,
  7  7 or construct any new water plant or other water=producing
  7  8 facility. The bill also prohibits a water utility and certain
  7  9 cities from the following activities related to the water
  7 10 supply system:
  7 11    1. Leasing, selling, or otherwise disposing of any
  7 12 real property or acquiring any new real property or debt
  7 13 obligations.
  7 14    2. Issuing revenue bonds or assuming any other form of
  7 15 obligations payable from the revenues of the water utility.
  7 16    3. Expending moneys for any purpose other than ongoing
  7 17 operations except as otherwise provided in the bill.
  7 18    The bill provides a definition for the term "receiving
  7 19 city", which includes a city receiving powers, duties, assets,
  7 20 or liabilities from the discontinued water utility. The
  7 21 bill requires each receiving city to enter into an agreement
  7 22 under Code chapter 28E before January 1, 2020, to establish
  7 23 or designate a regional water authority that shall provide
  7 24 water services, as previously provided by the discontinued
  7 25 water utility. The Code chapter 28E agreement is required to
  7 26 provide for the  creation of a regional water authority board
  7 27 and staggered six=year terms for the board's members. The bill
  7 28 also requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement provide the
  7 29 board with the authority to set the compensation for the board
  7 30 members.
  7 31    The bill requires the agreement to contain provisions for
  7 32 the appointment of members of the regional water authority
  7 33 board. The agreement must contain provisions for the
  7 34 composition of the regional water authority board and for
  7 35 the proportional representation of each receiving city, as
  8  1 specified in the bill. The bill also establishes arbitration
  8  2 and judicial review procedures in the event that receiving
  8  3 cities cannot agree on the composition of and proportional
  8  4 representation on the regional water authority board.
  8  5    The bill requires that the Code chapter 28E agreement
  8  6 provide for the transfer of assets and liabilities of the water
  8  7 supply system to the regional water authority and provide the
  8  8 regional water authority board with the same powers and duties
  8  9 of a city utility under Code chapter 388. The bill authorizes
  8 10 the agreement to provide the regional water authority board
  8 11 with additional powers and duties. The bill also requires
  8 12 that the agreement provide a means for other cities to join
  8 13 the regional water authority, and requires proportional
  8 14 representation of such cities on the regional water authority
  8 15 board.
  8 16    The bill also prohibits a regional water authority from
  8 17 expending any moneys or staff time to plan, design, or
  8 18 construct any new water plant or other water=producing facility
  8 19 before July 1, 2018.
