  3 16    The current expungement process for a conviction for alcohol
  3 17 consumption in public, public intoxication, or simulated public
  3 18 intoxication, or for a local ordinance is very similar to the
  3 19 new process in the bill, except that in order for a local
  3 20 ordinance to be expunged under the current expungement process,
  3 21 the local ordinance must arise out of the same transaction
  3 22 or occurrence.  In addition, the current expungement process
