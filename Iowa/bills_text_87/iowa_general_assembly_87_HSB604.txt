GENERAL.
This
bill
makes
a
number
of
changes
to
statutes
1


administered
by
the
secretary
of
state
which
relate
to
business
2


entities
such
as
corporations
operating
on
a
for-profit
basis
3


(Code
chapter
490,
the
“Iowa
Business
Corporation
Act”,
or
4


Code
chapter
491)
or
on
a
nonprofit
basis
(Code
chapter
504,
5


the
“Revised
Iowa
Nonprofit
Corporation
Act”),
or
a
limited
6


partnership
(Code
chapter
488,
the
“Uniform
Limited
Partnership
7


Act”).
The
statutory
changes
also
provide
for
the
filing
8


of
certain
documents
(referred
to
as
records)
to
secure
a
9


creditor’s
interest
in
a
debtor’s
property
(Code
chapter
554,
10


the
“Uniform
Commercial
Code”)
and
related
provisions.
11


GENERAL
——
BACKGROUND.
A
business
entity
is
classified
as
12


“domestic”
when
it
is
organized
or
formed
in
Iowa
(e.g.,
for
13


a
corporation,
including
a
nonprofit
corporation,
by
filing
14


articles
of
incorporation
and
receiving
a
certificate
of
15


existence).
A
business
entity
may
remain
organized
or
formed
16


under
a
repealed
Iowa
law
and
become
subject
to
a
succeeding
17


state
law.
Alternatively,
a
business
entity
is
classified
as
18


“foreign”
when
it
is
organized
or
formed
outside
of
Iowa
and
19


upon
application
to
the
secretary
of
state
is
recognized
to
20


do
business
in
this
state
(e.g.,
obtaining
a
certificate
of
21


authorization)
(Code
section
490.128).
22


NONPROFIT
CORPORATIONS
——
RESTRICTIONS
ON
ACQUIRING
23


AGRICULTURAL
LAND
AND
REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS.
The
bill
24


amends
Code
chapter
9H
which
restricts
certain
business
25


entities,
including
corporations,
from
acquiring
agricultural
26


land
suitable
for
use
in
farming
(Code
sections
9H.1(2)
and
27


9H.1(14)).
The
bill
also
amends
related
provisions
in
Code
28


chapter
10B
that
require
such
entities
file
landholding
reports
29


with
the
secretary
of
state.
Specifically,
the
bill
replaces
30


language
in
the
definition
of
“nonprofit
corporation”
that
31


describes
such
an
entity
as
“organized
under”
former
Code
32


chapter
504
as
published
in
the
1989
edition
of
the
Code
33


(prior
to
its
repeal)
or
“current”
Code
chapter
504
with
34

language
describing
a
nonprofit
corporation
as

defined
in

which
includes

both
a

It
eliminates
a
2


part
of
the
definition
that
recognizes
entities
qualifying
3


as
nonprofit
corporations
under
the
Internal
Revenue
Code.
4


It
also
makes
corresponding
changes
to
another
statute
that
5


allows
a
nonprofit
corporation
to
acquire
agricultural
land
for
6


research
or
experimental
purposes
under
two
exceptions:
(1)
7


when
agricultural
land
is
acquired
for
research
or
experimental
8


purposes
by
a
domestic
corporation
(Code
section
9H.4(1)(b))
9


and
(2)
when

14


Prior

July
1,
1990,
a
nonprofit
domestic

15


could
have
been
organized
under
two
now
former
Code

16


former

the

On

was

27


existing

One

that
a

to
the
“Iowa

is

This

The

provides
that
in

the
case
of
a

organized
under
Code
chapter
491,
a
15


director’s
“conflict

Under


27


the
“Iowa
Business
Corporation
Act”,
a
director’s
conflicting
28


interest
transaction
involves
a
director
who
is
a
party
to
a
29


transaction
that
affects
the
corporation,
had
knowledge
of
a
30


material
financial
interest
in
such

31


a

person
was
a

to
or
had
a
material
financial
32


interest
in
the
transaction
(Code
section
490.862).
The
safe
33

applies
to
exempt
a
director’s
conduct,
and
34


consequently
validates
a
conflicting

transaction

FILINGS
——
BACKGROUND.
A
person
alleging
that
they
are
20


a
creditor
acting
under
contract
(secured
party)
may
file
21


a
number
of
different
types
of
records
in
order
to
ensure
22


priority
over
other
secured
parties
who
file
later
when
23


claiming
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
the
collateral
in
the
event
24


that
the
debtor
defaults
upon
a
debt
obligation
subject
to
the
25


security
agreement.
The
records
include
a
financing
statement
26


used
in
order
to
“perfect”
a
security
interest
in
collateral
27


usually
possessed
by
the
debtor
(Code
sections
554.9501,
28


554.9502,
and
554.9510),
an
amendment
to
the
financing
29


statement
(Code
section
554.9512),
a
statement
correcting
an
30


incorrect
statement
on
record,
or
a
termination
statement
(Code
31


section
554.9513).
A
secured
party
almost
always
files
a
32


record
in
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
state.
The
financing
33


statement
or
an
amendment
to
the
financing
statement
that
34


adds
collateral
covered
by
the
financing
statement
