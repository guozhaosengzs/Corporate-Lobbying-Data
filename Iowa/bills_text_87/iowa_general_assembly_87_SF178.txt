  6 31 is likely to be construed as, inconsistent with law.
  6 32    c.  Despite the existence of a violation, the violation is

  7  7 arbitrary or capricious manner.

 11 27 common interest community or at a place convenient to the unit
 11 28 owners of the common interest community unless the unit owners
 11 29 amend the bylaws to vary the location of such meetings.
 11 30    d.  Unless the meeting is called to address an emergency,
 11 31 at each executive board meeting, the executive board shall
 11 32 provide a reasonable opportunity for unit owners to comment on

 12 19 may participate in the conference directly or by meeting at a
 12 20 central location or conference connection.
 12 21    (2)  The process provides all unit owners the opportunity
 12 22 to hear or perceive the discussion and to comment on matters
 12 23 before the executive board.
 12 24    h.  Following termination of the period of declarant control,
 12 25 unit owners may amend the bylaws to vary the procedures for

 12 33 consent only to undertake ministerial actions or to implement
 12 34 actions previously taken at a meeting of the executive board.
 12 35    j.  Unless otherwise restricted by this chapter or the common

 13  4 of the executive board upon a finding by a majority of the

 13 10 months.
 13 11    l.  An action by an executive board that is not in compliance

 13 14 for failure to comply with this section shall not be brought
 13 15 more than sixty days after the minutes of the executive board
 13 16 meeting at which the action was taken are approved or the
 13 17 record of that action is distributed to unit owners, whichever
 13 18 is later.
 13 19    Sec. 9.    9 34 owners of that information, including but not limited to:

 10 23 executive sessions. The executive board and committees of the
 10 24 unit owners association authorized to act for the association

 11 10 relating to a unit owner, a specific employee of the unit
 11 11 owners association, or a specific employee of an independent

 12 10 owners, except that the executive board is not required to make
 12 11 available copies of unapproved minutes or materials that are to
 12 12 be considered during an executive session.
 12 13    g.  Unless otherwise provided in the declaration or bylaws,

 12 34 actions previously taken at a meeting of the executive board.
 12 35    j.  Unless otherwise restricted by this chapter or the common

 17 14                           EXPLANATION
 17 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 17    Division I of this bill creates an Iowa common interest
 17 18 ownership Act, new Code chapter 499C.  The bill provides that
 17 19 it is the public policy of the state that the management and
 17 20 affairs of common interest communities be conducted openly and
 17 21 that the new Code chapter is to be construed to provide open
 17 22 access to the management of the common interest community for
 17 23 the unit owners.
 17 24    New Code chapter 499C defines "common interest community"
 17 25 to mean real estate described in a declaration with respect
 17 26 to which a person, by virtue of the person's ownership of a
 17 27 unit, is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes,
 17 28 insurance premiums, maintenance, or improvement of, or services
 17 29 or other expenses related to, common elements, other units, or
 17 30 other real estate described in the declaration. Cooperatives
 17 31 under Code chapter 499A and horizontal property regimes under
 17 32 Code chapter 499B are also defined to be common interest
 17 33 communities. The bill specifies that a common interest
 17 34 community does not include a covenant that requires the owners
 17 35 of separate parcels of real estate to share certain costs or
 18  1 other obligations, unless all such owners consent in writing
 18  2 to the creation of a common interest community, and does not
 18  3 include a community where all units are owned by a single
 18  4 owner.
 18  5    The bill does not allow for the provisions of new Code
 18  6 chapter 499C to be varied by agreement, and rights conferred by
 18  7 new Code chapter 499C may not be waived.
 18  8    The bill specifies that unless otherwise provided by law new
 18  9 Code chapter 499C applies to all common interest communities
 18 10 established within this state having eight or more units.
 18 11 However, the bill provides that for horizontal property regimes
 18 12 with seven or fewer apartments, if the form of administration
 18 13 is a board of administration, the board of administration must
 18 14 comply with specified requirements of new Code chapter 499C
 18 15 regarding meetings, records, and notice.
 18 16    The bill establishes requirements and procedures for common
 18 17 interest communities, unit owners associations, and executive
 18 18 boards.
 18 19    The bill provides that the membership of a unit owners
 18 20 association shall at all times consist exclusively of all unit
 18 21 owners except following termination of the common interest
 18 22 community, at which time the unit owners association shall
 18 23 consist of all former unit owners entitled to distributions
 18 24 of proceeds or their heirs, successors, or assigns. The bill
 18 25 requires each unit owners association to have an executive
 18 26 board.  A unit owners association must be organized as a
 18 27 for=profit or nonprofit corporation, trust, limited liability
 18 28 company, partnership, unincorporated association, or any
 18 29 other form of organization authorized by the laws of this
 18 30 state. The bill provides that the requirements of new Code
 18 31 chapter 499C relating to a unit owners association preempt
 18 32 any conflicting provision of the statute under which the unit
 18 33 owners association is organized.
 18 34    The bill specifies the duties and powers of a unit owners
 18 35 association, including powers of the unit owners association
 19  1 for enforcement of the provisions of declaration, bylaws, or
 19  2 rules.
 19  3    The bill specifies the duties and powers of an executive
 19  4 board. An executive board, except as otherwise provided in the
 19  5 declaration, the bylaws, or other provision of law, acts on
 19  6 behalf of the unit owners association. The bill specifies the
 19  7 duty of care required for members and officers of the executive
 19  8 board.
 19  9    The bill establishes requirements relating to meetings of
 19 10 unit owners associations, executive boards, and committees
 19 11 of such entities including requirements for the contents
 19 12 of meeting notices, allowable actions during meetings,
 19 13 requirements relating to unit owner comments, and the manner
 19 14 in which meetings may be conducted. The bill also specifies
 19 15 the manner and the reasons for which certain meetings may be
 19 16 called.
 19 17    The bill enacts requirements relating to the retention of
 19 18 records by unit owners associations and specifies the records
 19 19 retained by a unit owners association which may be withheld
 19 20 from inspection and copying.
 19 21    The bill requires a unit owners association or executive
 19 22 board, as applicable, to deliver each notice required to be
 19 23 given by the association under new Code chapter 499C to the
 19 24 regular mail address or electronic mail address provided by
 19 25 each unit owner. If a regular mail or electronic mail address
 19 26 is not provided by the unit owner, the unit owners association
 19 27 may deliver the notice by a different method specified in
 19 28 the bill. The bill provides that the ineffectiveness of a
 19 29 good=faith effort to deliver notice does not invalidate an
 19 30 action taken at a meeting or an action taken by other means.
 19 31    The bill provides that a declarant, unit owners association,
 19 32 unit owner, or any other person subject to new Code chapter
 19 33 499C may bring an action to enforce a right granted or
 19 34 obligation imposed by the Code chapter, the declaration, or the
 19 35 bylaws. In any such action, the court may award reasonable
 20  1 attorney fees to the prevailing party.
 20  2    Division II of the bill makes corresponding changes relating
 20  3 to the enactment of new Code chapter 499C.

 18 35 association, including powers of the unit owners association

 17 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 17    Division I of this bill creates an Iowa common interest
 17 18 ownership Act, new Code chapter 499C.  The bill provides that
 17 19 it is the public policy of the state that the management and
 17 20 affairs of common interest communities be conducted openly and
 17 21 that the new Code chapter is to be construed to provide open
 17 22 access to the management of the common interest community for
 17 23 the unit owners.
 17 24    New Code chapter 499C defines "common interest community"
 17 25 to mean real estate described in a declaration with respect
 17 26 to which a person, by virtue of the person's ownership of a
 17 27 unit, is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes,
 17 28 insurance premiums, maintenance, or improvement of, or services
 17 29 or other expenses related to, common elements, other units, or
 17 30 other real estate described in the declaration. Cooperatives
 17 31 under Code chapter 499A and horizontal property regimes under
 17 32 Code chapter 499B are also defined to be common interest
 17 33 communities. The bill specifies that a common interest
 17 34 community does not include a covenant that requires the owners
 17 35 of separate parcels of real estate to share certain costs or
 18  1 other obligations, unless all such owners consent in writing
 18  2 to the creation of a common interest community, and does not
 18  3 include a community where all units are owned by a single
 18  4 owner.
 18  5    The bill does not allow for the provisions of new Code

 18 14 comply with specified requirements of new Code chapter 499C
 18 15 regarding meetings, records, and notice.
 18 16    The bill establishes requirements and procedures for common
 18 17 interest communities, unit owners associations, and executive

 18 20 association shall at all times consist exclusively of all unit
 18 21 owners except following termination of the common interest
 18 22 community, at which time the unit owners association shall
 18 23 consist of all former unit owners entitled to distributions
 18 24 of proceeds or their heirs, successors, or assigns. The bill
 18 25 requires each unit owners association to have an executive
 18 26 board.  A unit owners association must be organized as a
 18 27 for=profit or nonprofit corporation, trust, limited liability
 18 28 company, partnership, unincorporated association, or any
 18 29 other form of organization authorized by the laws of this
 18 30 state. The bill provides that the requirements of new Code
 18 31 chapter 499C relating to a unit owners association preempt
 18 32 any conflicting provision of the statute under which the unit
 18 33 owners association is organized.
 18 34    The bill specifies the duties and powers of a unit owners
 18 35 association, including powers of the unit owners association
 19  1 for enforcement of the provisions of declaration, bylaws, or
 19  2 rules.
 19  3    The bill specifies the duties and powers of an executive
 19  4 board. An executive board, except as otherwise provided in the
 19  5 declaration, the bylaws, or other provision of law, acts on

 19  7 duty of care required for members and officers of the executive
 19  8 board.
 19  9    The bill establishes requirements relating to meetings of
 19 10 unit owners associations, executive boards, and committees
 19 11 of such entities including requirements for the contents
 19 12 of meeting notices, allowable actions during meetings,
 19 13 requirements relating to unit owner comments, and the manner
 19 14 in which meetings may be conducted. The bill also specifies

 19 22 board, as applicable, to deliver each notice required to be
 19 23 given by the association under new Code chapter 499C to the
 19 24 regular mail address or electronic mail address provided by
 19 25 each unit owner. If a regular mail or electronic mail address
 19 26 is not provided by the unit owner, the unit owners association
 19 27 may deliver the notice by a different method specified in
 19 28 the bill. The bill provides that the ineffectiveness of a
 19 29 good=faith effort to deliver notice does not invalidate an
 19 30 action taken at a meeting or an action taken by other means.
 19 31    The bill provides that a declarant, unit owners association,
 19 32 unit owner, or any other person subject to new Code chapter
 19 33 499C may bring an action to enforce a right granted or

 18 15 regarding meetings, records, and notice.
 18 16    The bill establishes requirements and procedures for common

 19 11 of such entities including requirements for the contents

 19 14 in which meetings may be conducted. The bill also specifies
 19 15 the manner and the reasons for which certain meetings may be

 19 22 board, as applicable, to deliver each notice required to be
 19 23 given by the association under new Code chapter 499C to the
 19 24 regular mail address or electronic mail address provided by
 19 25 each unit owner. If a regular mail or electronic mail address
 19 26 is not provided by the unit owner, the unit owners association
 19 27 may deliver the notice by a different method specified in
 19 28 the bill. The bill provides that the ineffectiveness of a

 19 30 action taken at a meeting or an action taken by other means.
 19 31    The bill provides that a declarant, unit owners association,
 19 32 unit owner, or any other person subject to new Code chapter
 19 33 499C may bring an action to enforce a right granted or
