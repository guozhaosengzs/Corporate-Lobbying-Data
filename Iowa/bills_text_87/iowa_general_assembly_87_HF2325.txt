  7  8    This bill relates to the awareness and prevention of
  7  9 child sexual abuse, harassment, and exploitation, and to
  7 10 criminal penalties and civil remedies and penalties for human
  7 11 trafficking, and directs the department of human services to

  7 15 education to include materials and resources on child abuse

  8 11 victim surcharge in Code sections 911.2A and 911.2B.

  8 16 person under the age of 18 who commits a public offense

  7  4 recommendations the workgroup deems relevant.
  7  5                           EXPLANATION
  7  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  8    This bill relates to the awareness and prevention of
  7  9 child sexual abuse, harassment, and exploitation, and to
  7 10 criminal penalties and civil remedies and penalties for human
  7 11 trafficking, and directs the department of human services to
  7 12 facilitate a workgroup study relating to mandatory reporter
  7 13 training and certification requirements.
  7 14    The bill requires the director of the department of
  7 15 education to include materials and resources on child abuse
  7 16 and child exploitation in the age=appropriate, developmentally
  7 17 appropriate, and research=based materials the director is
  7 18 currently required to develop and make available to school
  7 19 districts. The bill requires the board of educational
  7 20 examiners to disqualify an applicant for a license or remove
  7 21 the license of a person who has been found guilty or pled
  7 22 guilty to solicitation of human trafficking pursuant to Code
  7 23 section 710A.2B.  This a new requirement. Each school board
  7 24 must include age=appropriate, developmentally appropriate,
  7 25 and research=based instruction on child sexual abuse, child
  7 26 exploitation, and child sexual harassment as part of its human
  7 27 growth and development curriculum for grades one through
  7 28 twelve. The bill requires the board of educational examiners
  7 29 to adopt rules establishing licensing requirements that include
  7 30 training on child sexual abuse, child exploitation, and child
  7 31 sexual harassment.
  7 32    The bill increases the criminal penalty for a person who
  7 33 engages in any form of human trafficking with a victim who
  7 34 is younger than 18 years of age from a class "C" felony to
  7 35 a class "B" felony, which is punishable by confinement for
  8  1 no more than 25 years. The bill provides that a person who
  8  2 engages in solicitation for human trafficking is guilty of
  8  3 a class "C" felony and guilty of a class "B" felony if the
  8  4 victim is younger than 18 years of age. A class "C" felony
  8  5 is punishable by confinement for no more than 10 years and a
  8  6 fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. A class "B"
  8  7 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than 25 years.
  8  8 Solicitation for human trafficking is not currently a criminal
  8  9 offense. A person who is found guilty of or given a deferred
  8 10 judgment for solicitation shall pay the human trafficking
  8 11 victim surcharge in Code sections 911.2A and 911.2B.
  8 12    The bill provides that a human trafficking victim may seek
  8 13 civil remedies as outlined in the bill. Current law does not
  8 14 provide for a civil remedy for victims of human trafficking.
  8 15    The bill provides for immunity from prosecution for a
  8 16 person under the age of 18 who commits a public offense
  8 17 under Code chapter 710A (human trafficking) or Code section
  8 18 725.1 (prostitution). Such person shall not be criminally
  8 19 liable or subject to juvenile delinquency proceedings and the
  8 20 county attorney shall refer such person to the department of
  8 21 human services for the possible filing of a child in need of
  8 22 assistance petition.
  8 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
  8 24 facilitate a study by a workgroup of stakeholders to make
  8 25 recommendations relating to mandatory reporter training
  8 26 and certification requirements. The composition of the
  8 27 stakeholders for the workgroup is detailed in the bill. The
  8 28 workgroup shall submit a report to the general assembly on
  8 29 or before December 14, 2018, with recommendations on the
  8 30 appropriate content of mandatory training, the appropriate
  8 31 frequency of training for mandatory reporters, the appropriate

  7  5                           EXPLANATION
  7  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  8    This bill relates to the awareness and prevention of
  7  9 child sexual abuse, harassment, and exploitation, and to
  7 10 criminal penalties and civil remedies and penalties for human
  7 11 trafficking, and directs the department of human services to
  7 12 facilitate a workgroup study relating to mandatory reporter
  7 13 training and certification requirements.
  7 14    The bill requires the director of the department of
  7 15 education to include materials and resources on child abuse
  7 16 and child exploitation in the age=appropriate, developmentally
  7 17 appropriate, and research=based materials the director is
  7 18 currently required to develop and make available to school
  7 19 districts. The bill requires the board of educational
  7 20 examiners to disqualify an applicant for a license or remove
  7 21 the license of a person who has been found guilty or pled
  7 22 guilty to solicitation of human trafficking pursuant to Code
  7 23 section 710A.2B.  This a new requirement. Each school board
  7 24 must include age=appropriate, developmentally appropriate,
  7 25 and research=based instruction on child sexual abuse, child
  7 26 exploitation, and child sexual harassment as part of its human
  7 27 growth and development curriculum for grades one through
  7 28 twelve. The bill requires the board of educational examiners
  7 29 to adopt rules establishing licensing requirements that include
  7 30 training on child sexual abuse, child exploitation, and child
  7 31 sexual harassment.
  7 32    The bill increases the criminal penalty for a person who
  7 33 engages in any form of human trafficking with a victim who
  7 34 is younger than 18 years of age from a class "C" felony to
  7 35 a class "B" felony, which is punishable by confinement for
  8  1 no more than 25 years. The bill provides that a person who
  8  2 engages in solicitation for human trafficking is guilty of
  8  3 a class "C" felony and guilty of a class "B" felony if the
  8  4 victim is younger than 18 years of age. A class "C" felony
  8  5 is punishable by confinement for no more than 10 years and a
  8  6 fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. A class "B"
  8  7 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than 25 years.
  8  8 Solicitation for human trafficking is not currently a criminal
  8  9 offense. A person who is found guilty of or given a deferred
  8 10 judgment for solicitation shall pay the human trafficking
  8 11 victim surcharge in Code sections 911.2A and 911.2B.
  8 12    The bill provides that a human trafficking victim may seek
  8 13 civil remedies as outlined in the bill. Current law does not
  8 14 provide for a civil remedy for victims of human trafficking.
  8 15    The bill provides for immunity from prosecution for a
  8 16 person under the age of 18 who commits a public offense
  8 17 under Code chapter 710A (human trafficking) or Code section
  8 18 725.1 (prostitution). Such person shall not be criminally
  8 19 liable or subject to juvenile delinquency proceedings and the
  8 20 county attorney shall refer such person to the department of
  8 21 human services for the possible filing of a child in need of
  8 22 assistance petition.
  8 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
  8 24 facilitate a study by a workgroup of stakeholders to make
  8 25 recommendations relating to mandatory reporter training
  8 26 and certification requirements. The composition of the
  8 27 stakeholders for the workgroup is detailed in the bill. The
  8 28 workgroup shall submit a report to the general assembly on
  8 29 or before December 14, 2018, with recommendations on the
  8 30 appropriate content of mandatory training, the appropriate
  8 31 frequency of training for mandatory reporters, the appropriate
  8 32 delivery methodology for training, the appropriate metrics
  8 33 for measuring that training objectives have been met, and the
  8 34 appropriate requirements to obtain and maintain mandatory
  8 35 reporter certification.
  9  1 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  9  2 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  9  3 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  9  4 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  9  5 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  9  6 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  9  7 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  9  8 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  9  9 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  7  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  8    This bill relates to the awareness and prevention of
  7  9 child sexual abuse, harassment, and exploitation, and to
  7 10 criminal penalties and civil remedies and penalties for human
  7 11 trafficking, and directs the department of human services to
  7 12 facilitate a workgroup study relating to mandatory reporter
  7 13 training and certification requirements.
  7 14    The bill requires the director of the department of
  7 15 education to include materials and resources on child abuse
  7 16 and child exploitation in the age=appropriate, developmentally
  7 17 appropriate, and research=based materials the director is
  7 18 currently required to develop and make available to school
  7 19 districts. The bill requires the board of educational
  7 20 examiners to disqualify an applicant for a license or remove
  7 21 the license of a person who has been found guilty or pled
  7 22 guilty to solicitation of human trafficking pursuant to Code
  7 23 section 710A.2B.  This a new requirement. Each school board
  7 24 must include age=appropriate, developmentally appropriate,
  7 25 and research=based instruction on child sexual abuse, child
  7 26 exploitation, and child sexual harassment as part of its human
  7 27 growth and development curriculum for grades one through
  7 28 twelve. The bill requires the board of educational examiners
  7 29 to adopt rules establishing licensing requirements that include
  7 30 training on child sexual abuse, child exploitation, and child
  7 31 sexual harassment.
  7 32    The bill increases the criminal penalty for a person who
  7 33 engages in any form of human trafficking with a victim who
  7 34 is younger than 18 years of age from a class "C" felony to
  7 35 a class "B" felony, which is punishable by confinement for
  8  1 no more than 25 years. The bill provides that a person who
  8  2 engages in solicitation for human trafficking is guilty of
  8  3 a class "C" felony and guilty of a class "B" felony if the
  8  4 victim is younger than 18 years of age. A class "C" felony
  8  5 is punishable by confinement for no more than 10 years and a
  8  6 fine of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000. A class "B"
  8  7 felony is punishable by confinement for no more than 25 years.
  8  8 Solicitation for human trafficking is not currently a criminal
  8  9 offense. A person who is found guilty of or given a deferred
  8 10 judgment for solicitation shall pay the human trafficking
  8 11 victim surcharge in Code sections 911.2A and 911.2B.
  8 12    The bill provides that a human trafficking victim may seek
  8 13 civil remedies as outlined in the bill. Current law does not
  8 14 provide for a civil remedy for victims of human trafficking.
  8 15    The bill provides for immunity from prosecution for a
  8 16 person under the age of 18 who commits a public offense
  8 17 under Code chapter 710A (human trafficking) or Code section
