The
bill
eliminates
jury
commissions.
As
a
result,
counties
1


will
be
required
to
use
jury
managers
to
draw
master
jury
lists
2


and
identify
jurors.
The
bill
also
requires
that
an
electronic
3


data
processing
system
be
used
to
create
a
master
jury
list
and
4


for
the
random
drawing
of
jurors.
5


Under
current
law,
the
master
jury
list
must
be
updated
once
6


every
two
years.
The
master
jury
list
is
the
list
of
names
7


taken
from
all
source
lists,
including
the
voter
registration
8


list
and
the
motor
vehicle
operators
list,
for
possible
jury
9


service.
The
bill
requires
that
the
master
jury
list
be
10


updated
every
year,
and
that
the
master
jury
list
include
the
11


list
of
names
from
the
nonoperators
identification
list.
12


The
bill
provides
that
jury
managers
and
the
state
court
13


administrator
are
responsible
for
implementing
the
provisions
14


of
the
bill.
15


The
bill
makes
conforming
changes.
