  3 20    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018, each

  3 34 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  3 35 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  4  1 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be

  4  5 cash reserve during the base year to fund a budget adjustment
  4  6 authorized in the bill, the board of directors of the school
  4  7 district shall include in its general fund budget document
  4  8 information about the amount of the cash reserve used for such
