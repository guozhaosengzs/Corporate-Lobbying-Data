the
general
assembly.
1


This
bill
allows
individuals,
on
or
after
January
1,
2018,
2


to
open
an
interest-bearing
savings
account
with
a
state
3


or
federally
chartered
bank,
savings
and
loan
association,
4


credit
union,
or
trust
company
in
this
state
and
designate
the
5


account
as
a
first-time
homebuyer
savings
account
(account)
6


for
the
purpose
of
financing
the
purchase
of
a
single-family
7


residence
in
this
state
by
a
first-time
homebuyer.
“First-time
8


homebuyer”
is
defined
in
the
bill
to
include
Iowa
residents
who
9


have
not
owned
a
single-family
residence
for
at
least
three
10


years
prior
to
the
home
purchase
for
which
the
account’s
funds
11


are
applied.
“Single-family
residence”
is
also
defined
in
the
12


bill.
The
account
may
be
established
individually,
or
jointly
13


with
a
spouse
if
the
married
couple
files
a
joint
Iowa
income
14


tax
return.
15


In
order
to
properly
establish
the
account,
the
bill
16


requires
the
account
holder
to
submit
certain
forms
to
the
17


department
of
revenue
(department)
designating
the
account
as
18


a
first-time

savings
account,
and
designating
one
19


beneficiary
of
the
account
(designated
beneficiary).
These
20


designation
forms
must
be
submitted
no
later
than
April
30
of
21


the
year
following
the
tax
year
during
which
the
account
is
22


opened.
An
individual
may
establish
more
than
one
account,
23


provided
each
account
has
a
different
designated
beneficiary.
24


The
account
holder
may
change
the
designated
beneficiary
at
any
25


time,
and
may
designate
himself
or
herself
as
the
beneficiary.
26


In
addition,
an
individual
may
be
the
designated
beneficiary
27


of
more
than
one
account.
The
designated
beneficiary
must
be
28


a
first-time
homebuyer.
29


Contributions
to
an
account
may
be
made
in
the
form
of
cash
30


by
any
person
and
in
any
amount.
There
is
no
limitation
on
the
31


amount
that
may
be
retained
in
an
account.
In
addition,
the
32


account
holder
may
withdraw
funds
from
an
account
at
any
time.
33


Account
funds
shall
not
be
used
to
pay
expenses,
if
any,
of
34


administering
the
account,
except
that

and
charges
may

deducted
from
the
account
by
the
financial
institution
where
1


the
account
is
held.
The
bill
requires
an
account
holder
to
2


submit
certain
reports
to
the
department,
including
an
annual
3


report
for
the
account,
a
transaction
report
upon
a
withdrawal
4


of
funds
from
the
account,
and
a
copy
of
any
federal
Internal
5


Revenue
Service
form
1099
or
other
similar
income
statement
6


issued
for
the
account.
7


The
bill
provides
protection
to
financial
institutions
from
8


being
required
to
perform,
and
from
being
responsible
or
liable
9


for,
certain
activities
as
described
in
the
bill
with
respect
10


to
accounts.
The
bill
requires
the
department
to
create
the
11


forms
required
to
be
filed
by
account
holders,
and
to
adopt
12


rules
to
implement
and
administer
the
bill.
13


The
bill
provides
two
individual
income
tax
incentives
14


relating
to
the
accounts.
First,
an
account
holder
is
15


allowed
to
deduct
from
the
individual
income
tax
the
amount
of
16


contributions
made
during
the
year
by
the
account
holder
to
17


the
account
holder’s
accounts,
not
to
exceed
$2,000
per
year,
18


or
$4,000
for
married
taxpayers
with
a
joint
account.
These
19


amounts
are
adjusted
for
inflation
each
calendar
year.
Second,
20


the
bill
exempts
from
the
individual
income
tax
any
interest
21


or
earnings
received
from
the
account
holder’s
accounts.
22


The
total
amount
that
may
be
deducted
or
excluded
from
the
23


individual
income
tax
for
these
two
tax
incentives
cannot
24


exceed
an
aggregate
lifetime
limit
of
10
times
the
maximum
25


deduction
determined
above
for
the
applicable
year
($20,000
for
26


2016),
or
double
that
amount
for
married
taxpayers
with
a
joint
27


account
($40,000
for
2016).
The
account
holder’s
ability
to
28


claim
the
tax
incentives
ends
10
tax
years
after
the
tax
year
29


the
account
holder
first
opened
an
account,
or
on
the
date
when
30


account
funds
are
withdrawn
for
purposes
other
than
the
payment
31


or
reimbursement
of
the
designated
beneficiary’s
eligible
32


home
costs
in
connection
with
a
qualified
home
purchase
33


(nonqualified
withdrawal),
whichever
occurs
first.
“Eligible
34


home
costs”
and
“qualified
home
purchase”

the
bill.
Amounts
transferred
between
different
accounts
of
1


the
same
account
holder
by
a
person
other
than
the
account
2


holder
are
not
considered
a
nonqualified
withdrawal
that
would
3


cause
loss
of
the
ability
to
claim
the
tax
incentives.
4


The
bill
requires
an
account
holder
to
add
to
net
income
for
5


purposes
of
calculating
the
individual
income
tax
any
amount
of
6


a
nonqualified
withdrawal
from
an
account
to
the
extent
it
was
7


previously
deducted
as
a
contribution,
but
amounts
transferred
8


between
different
accounts
of
the
same
account
holder
by
9


a
person
other
than
the
account
holder
are
not
considered
10


nonqualified
withdrawals.
In
addition,
any
amount
remaining
in
11


an
account
holder’s
account
on
January
1
of
the
10th
calendar
12


year
after
the
calendar
year
during
which
the
account
holder
13


first
opened
an
account
is
considered
to
be
a
nonqualified
14


withdrawal
that
must
be
added
to
net
income
for
the
tax
year
15


beginning
in
that
10th
year,
to
the
extent
it
was
previously
16


deducted
as
a
contribution.
Nonqualified
withdrawals
required
17


to
be
added
to
net
income
are
also
subject
to
a
penalty
equal
18


to
10
percent
of
the
nonqualified
withdrawal,
unless
the
19


withdrawal
was
made
by
reason
of
the
death
or
disability
of
the
20


account
holder,
or
was
made
pursuant
to
a
garnishment,
levy,
21


or
other
order,
including
an
order
in
bankruptcy
following
a
22


filing
for
protection
under
the
federal
bankruptcy
code.
23


Finally,
the
bill
prohibits
the
amount
of
eligible
home
24


costs
in
connection
with
a
qualified
home
purchase
that
are
25


paid
or
reimbursed
from
funds
in
an
account
from
being
allowed
26


as
an
itemized
deduction
for
Iowa
individual
income
tax


27


purposes.
28


The
tax
provisions
of
the
bill
apply
to
tax
years
beginning
29


on
or
after
January
1,
2018.
