  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement
  6 14 project or a highway, bridge, or culvert project designated as
  6 15 [name of project] for which you have or may have provided labor
  6 16 or materials. The request will be made pursuant to Iowa Code
  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay
  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this
  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public

  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code

  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15

  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a

  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall

  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a

  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement

  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement
  6 14 project or a highway, bridge, or culvert project designated as
  6 15 [name of project] for which you have or may have provided labor
  6 16 or materials. The request will be made pursuant to Iowa Code
  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay
  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this
  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement

  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have

  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this

  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement
  6 14 project or a highway, bridge, or culvert project designated as
  6 15 [name of project] for which you have or may have provided labor
  6 16 or materials. The request will be made pursuant to Iowa Code
  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay
  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this
  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  5 31 request for release of retained funds.
  5 32    e.  The contractor shall release retained funds to the

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement
  6 14 project or a highway, bridge, or culvert project designated as
  6 15 [name of project] for which you have or may have provided labor
  6 16 or materials. The request will be made pursuant to Iowa Code
  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay
  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this
  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement
  6 14 project or a highway, bridge, or culvert project designated as
  6 15 [name of project] for which you have or may have provided labor
  6 16 or materials. The request will be made pursuant to Iowa Code
  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay
  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this
  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement
  6 14 project or a highway, bridge, or culvert project designated as
  6 15 [name of project] for which you have or may have provided labor
  6 16 or materials. The request will be made pursuant to Iowa Code
  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay
  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this
  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement

  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this

  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement
  6 14 project or a highway, bridge, or culvert project designated as
  6 15 [name of project] for which you have or may have provided labor
  6 16 or materials. The request will be made pursuant to Iowa Code
  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay
  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this
  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  4 16 designated portion of the public improvement for its intended
  4 17 purpose. This subparagraph shall not apply to highway, bridge,
  4 18 or culvert projects.

  4 29    2.  Payments made by a governmental entity or the  department
  4 30 for the construction of public improvements and highway,
  4 31 bridge, or culvert projects shall be made in accordance with
  4 32 the provisions of this chapter, except as provided in this
  4 33 section:

  6  8    g.  The notice shall be substantially similar to the
  6  9 following:
  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement
  6 14 project or a highway, bridge, or culvert project designated as
  6 15 [name of project] for which you have or may have provided labor
  6 16 or materials. The request will be made pursuant to Iowa Code
  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay
  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this
  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  5 30 in writing within thirty calendar days of the receipt of the

  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a

  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction

  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement

  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  4 12    (2)  The work on the public improvement or on the designated
  4 13 portion is substantially completed in general accordance with
  4 14 the terms of the contract so that the governmental entity or
  4 15 the department can occupy or utilize the public improvement or

  4 17 purpose. This subparagraph shall not apply to highway, bridge,
  4 18 or culvert projects.

  5  7    b.  Except as provided under paragraph "c", upon receipt of
  5  8 the request, the governmental entity or the department shall
  5  9 release all or part of the retained funds. Retained funds that

  5 34 funds are released to the contractor by the governmental entity
  5 35 or the department. Each subcontractor shall pass through to

  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15

  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected

  5  7    b.  Except as provided under paragraph "c", upon receipt of

  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public

  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall

  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a

  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement
  6 14 project or a highway, bridge, or culvert project designated as
  6 15 [name of project] for which you have or may have provided labor

  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay
  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this
  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  5  7    b.  Except as provided under paragraph "c", upon receipt of
  5  8 the request, the governmental entity or the department shall
  5  9 release all or part of the retained funds. Retained funds that
  5 10 are approved as payable shall be paid at the time of the next
  5 11 monthly payment or within thirty days, whichever is sooner. If
  5 12 partial retained funds are released pursuant to a contractor's
  5 13 request, no retained funds shall be subsequently held based

  5 15 payment becomes due the governmental entity or the department
  5 16 does not release the retained funds due, interest shall accrue

  5 35 or the department. Each subcontractor shall pass through to

  6  2 the contractor.
  6  3    f.  Prior to applying for release of retained funds, the

  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement
  6 14 project or a highway, bridge, or culvert project designated as
  6 15 [name of project] for which you have or may have provided labor
  6 16 or materials. The request will be made pursuant to Iowa Code
  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay
  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this
  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.

  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  5  2 of all or part of the retained funds owed. The request shall be
  5  3 accompanied by a sworn statement of the contractor that, ten
  5  4 calendar days prior to filing the request, notice was given as

  5  7    b.  Except as provided under paragraph "c", upon receipt of

  5  9 release all or part of the retained funds. Retained funds that
  5 10 are approved as payable shall be paid at the time of the next
  5 11 monthly payment or within thirty days, whichever is sooner. If
  5 12 partial retained funds are released pursuant to a contractor's
  5 13 request, no retained funds shall be subsequently held based
  5 14 on that portion of the work. If within thirty days of when
  5 15 payment becomes due the governmental entity or the department
  5 16 does not release the retained funds due, interest shall accrue

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement

  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay

  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement
  6 14 project or a highway, bridge, or culvert project designated as
  6 15 [name of project] for which you have or may have provided labor

  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay
  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this
  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.

  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  6 10    NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR'S REQUEST
  6 11  FOR EARLY RELEASE OF RETAINED FUNDS
  6 12    You are hereby notified that [name of contractor] will be
  6 13 requesting an early release of funds on a public improvement
  6 14 project or a highway, bridge, or culvert project designated as
  6 15 [name of project] for which you have or may have provided labor
  6 16 or materials. The request will be made pursuant to Iowa Code
  6 17 section 573.28. The request may be filed with the [name of
  6 18 governmental entity or department] after ten calendar days from
  6 19 the date of this notice. The purpose of the request is to have
  6 20 [name of governmental entity or department] release and pay
  6 21 funds for all work that has been performed and charged to [name
  6 22 of governmental entity or department] as of the date of this
  6 23 notice. This notice is provided in accordance with Iowa Code
  6 24 section 573.28.
  6 25    Sec. 6.  REPEAL.  Section 26.13, Code 2018, is repealed.
  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no
  7 26 longer applies to all competitive bidding done pursuant to Code
  7 27 section 26.3 or 314.1.

  5  7    b.  Except as provided under paragraph "c", upon receipt of
  5  8 the request, the governmental entity or the department shall
  5  9 release all or part of the retained funds. Retained funds that
  5 10 are approved as payable shall be paid at the time of the next
  5 11 monthly payment or within thirty days, whichever is sooner. If
  5 12 partial retained funds are released pursuant to a contractor's
  5 13 request, no retained funds shall be subsequently held based
  5 14 on that portion of the work. If within thirty days of when
  5 15 payment becomes due the governmental entity or the department
  5 16 does not release the retained funds due, interest shall accrue
  5 17 on the amount of retained funds at the rate of interest that is
  5 18 calculated as the prime rate plus one percent per year as of
  5 19 the day interest begins to accrue until the amount is paid.
  5 20    c.  If labor and materials are yet to be provided at the
  5 21 time the request for the release of the retained funds is made,
  5 22 an amount equal to two hundred percent of the value of the
  5 23 labor or materials yet to be provided, as determined by the
  5 24 governmental entity's or the department's authorized contract
  5 25 representative, may be withheld until such labor or materials
  5 26 are provided.
  5 27    d.  An itemization of the labor or materials yet to be
  5 28 provided, or the reason that the request for release of
  5 29 retained funds is denied, shall be provided to the contractor
  5 30 in writing within thirty calendar days of the receipt of the
  5 31 request for release of retained funds.
  5 32    e.  The contractor shall release retained funds to the
  5 33 subcontractor or subcontractors in the same manner as retained
  5 34 funds are released to the contractor by the governmental entity
  5 35 or the department. Each subcontractor shall pass through to
  6  1 each lower=tier subcontractor all retained fund payments from

  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no

  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a

  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception

  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The

  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected

  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.
  7  5 The bill also provides that a lien statement shall not be
  7  6 amended to increase the amount demanded.
  7  7    PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION LIENS.  Current Code section 573.15
  7  8 provides an exception to the requirement that a public
  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims
  7 11 for materials furnished and labor performed. The exception
  7 12 provides that a public corporation need only retain funds due a
  7 13 supplier of material to a general contractor if the supplier
  7 14 provides the general contractor with one of two permitted types
  7 15 of notice after the materials are supplied. The bill provides
  7 16 that, in addition to claims for materials, the exception shall
  7 17 apply to claims for labor, service, or transportation. The
  7 18 bill also amends the notice requirement to provide that a
  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
  7 22    The bill repeals Code section 26.13 (public construction
  7 23 bidding ==== early release of retained funds), creates new Code
  7 24 section 573.28 with the same language except for corrected
  7 25 internal references, and provides that the Code section no

  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to mechanics' liens and public
  6 30 construction liens.
  6 31    MECHANIC'S LIENS.  Under current law, a lien statement may
  6 32 only be amended by leave of court in furtherance of justice
  6 33 or as to the amount demanded.  The bill provides that a
  6 34 claimant may only amend a lien statement by leave of court in
  6 35 furtherance of justice or to decrease the amount demanded.  An
  7  1 amendment to decrease the amount demanded must be accomplished
  7  2 through the mechanics' notice and lien registry.  The bill
  7  3 provides that amending a lien statement to decrease the amount
  7  4 demanded does not affect the priority of the lien statement.

  7  9 corporation retain a portion of funds due a contractor on a
  7 10 public improvement project in a fund for the payment of claims

  7 19 supplier of labor, materials, service, or transportation to a
  7 20 general contractor must give only one type of notice, along
  7 21 with a certified statement that such notice was given.
