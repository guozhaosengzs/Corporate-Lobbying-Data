  4 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 27    This bill shortens the periods of time associated with
  4 28 redemption of real property from foreclosure in Code chapter
  4 29 628.  It changes the period of time that a defendant=debtor may
  4 30 redeem real property from within one year of sale to within
  4 31 six months of sale.  It also changes the period in which the
  4 32 defendant=debtor has the exclusive right of redemption from six
  4 33 months after sale to three months after sale.  The period of
  4 34 redemption by creditors is reduced from nine months after sale
  4 35 to four months after sale.  After those four months, creditors
  5  1 cannot redeem from each other.  Unless the defendant=debtor
  5  2 redeems, the purchaser, or the creditor who last redeemed
  5  3 within four months of the day of sale, will hold the property
  5  4 absolutely.
  5  5    Under current law, a mortgagor and mortgagee can agree to
  5  6 reduce the period of redemption from foreclosure as described
  5  7 in the mortgage instrument to a period of six months.  The bill
  5  8 would allow the mortgagor and mortgagee to agree to reduce
  5  9 the period of redemption by the debtor to three months. The
  5 10 debtor's right of redemption would be exclusive the first
  5 11 month, as opposed to three months.  Under the bill, the time
  5 12 for redemption by creditors would be shortened from four months
  5 13 to two months.
  5 14    The bill also alters Code chapter 654.  The bill changes
  5 15 the notice requirement and rule for foreclosure without
  5 16 redemption by changing the length of time a sale can be
  5 17 delayed when a defendant=mortgagor makes a written demand to a
  5 18 plaintiff=mortgagee to delay sale.  The bill delays the sale by
  5 19 six months from entry of judgment as opposed to the current 12
  5 20 months.  If a plaintiff=mortgagee's petition includes a waiver
  5 21 of deficiency judgment, a defendant=mortgagor's written demand
  5 22 will only result in a three=month rather than a six=month delay
  5 23 of sale following entry of judgment.
  5 24    Notwithstanding Code section 628.3 when a foreclosure of
  5 25 a mortgage on real property results from enforcement of a
  5 26 due=on=sale clause, the bill amends Code section 535.8(4)(e)(1)
  5 27 to shorten the period that a mortgagor may redeem the real
  5 28 property from any time within three years to anytime within
  5 29 18 months from the day of sale under the levy. The bill also
  5 30 shortens the period during which the mortgagor's right of
  5 31 redemption is exclusive from the first 30 months to the first
  5 32 15 months and the period during which creditors may redeem
  5 33 under Code sections 628.5, 628.15, and 628.16 from 33 months
  5 34 to 16 months.

  4 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 27    This bill shortens the periods of time associated with
  4 28 redemption of real property from foreclosure in Code chapter
  4 29 628.  It changes the period of time that a defendant=debtor may
  4 30 redeem real property from within one year of sale to within
  4 31 six months of sale.  It also changes the period in which the
  4 32 defendant=debtor has the exclusive right of redemption from six
  4 33 months after sale to three months after sale.  The period of
  4 34 redemption by creditors is reduced from nine months after sale
  4 35 to four months after sale.  After those four months, creditors
  5  1 cannot redeem from each other.  Unless the defendant=debtor
  5  2 redeems, the purchaser, or the creditor who last redeemed
  5  3 within four months of the day of sale, will hold the property
  5  4 absolutely.
  5  5    Under current law, a mortgagor and mortgagee can agree to
  5  6 reduce the period of redemption from foreclosure as described
  5  7 in the mortgage instrument to a period of six months.  The bill
  5  8 would allow the mortgagor and mortgagee to agree to reduce
  5  9 the period of redemption by the debtor to three months. The
  5 10 debtor's right of redemption would be exclusive the first
  5 11 month, as opposed to three months.  Under the bill, the time
  5 12 for redemption by creditors would be shortened from four months
  5 13 to two months.
  5 14    The bill also alters Code chapter 654.  The bill changes
  5 15 the notice requirement and rule for foreclosure without
  5 16 redemption by changing the length of time a sale can be
  5 17 delayed when a defendant=mortgagor makes a written demand to a
  5 18 plaintiff=mortgagee to delay sale.  The bill delays the sale by
  5 19 six months from entry of judgment as opposed to the current 12
  5 20 months.  If a plaintiff=mortgagee's petition includes a waiver
  5 21 of deficiency judgment, a defendant=mortgagor's written demand
  5 22 will only result in a three=month rather than a six=month delay
  5 23 of sale following entry of judgment.
  5 24    Notwithstanding Code section 628.3 when a foreclosure of
  5 25 a mortgage on real property results from enforcement of a
  5 26 due=on=sale clause, the bill amends Code section 535.8(4)(e)(1)
  5 27 to shorten the period that a mortgagor may redeem the real
  5 28 property from any time within three years to anytime within
  5 29 18 months from the day of sale under the levy. The bill also
  5 30 shortens the period during which the mortgagor's right of
  5 31 redemption is exclusive from the first 30 months to the first
  5 32 15 months and the period during which creditors may redeem
  5 33 under Code sections 628.5, 628.15, and 628.16 from 33 months
  5 34 to 16 months.
