  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill provides law enforcement authorities with access
  5 30 to the ownership and control information of domestic business
  5 31 entities.
  5 32    The bill includes several definitions. The bill defines
  5 33 "appropriate request" to mean a civil, criminal, or
  5 34 administrative subpoena or summons from any state, local, or
  5 35 federal law enforcement authority. "Domestic business entity"
  6  1 is defined as a business entity organized under Iowa law that
  6  2 has no more than 50 interest holders on the effective date of
  6  3 its corporate or organizational existence, including but not
  6  4 limited to limited liability companies, corporations, nonprofit
  6  5 corporations, partnerships, limited partnerships, limited
  6  6 liability partnerships, limited liability limited partnerships,
  6  7 cooperative associations, and cooperatives. However, the
  6  8 definition of "domestic business entity" does not include any
  6  9 of the following: entities licensed to do business as banks
  6 10 or other depository institutions, trust companies, insurance
  6 11 companies, or securities or commodities brokers; entities
  6 12 registered as investment companies under federal law; entities
  6 13 registered as investment advisors under federal law; entities
  6 14 controlled by or under the control of any entity not included
  6 15 in the definition of "domestic business entity"; or entities
  6 16 registered as exempt organizations by the internal revenue
  6 17 service. "Governing individual" is defined as an individual
  6 18 who is designated to be responsible for governing a domestic
  6 19 business entity, including but not limited to directors and
  6 20 general partners. "Interest holder" is defined as a person who
  6 21 holds an interest in a domestic business entity, including but
  6 22 not limited to shareholders, general or limited partners, or
  6 23 members. "Person" is the same as defined in Code section 4.1.
  6 24 "Transferable interest" is defined as an interest holder's
  6 25 right to receive distributions. "Transferee" is defined as a
  6 26 person to which all or part of a transferable interest has been
  6 27 transferred.
  6 28    The bill requires a domestic business entity to provide
  6 29 ownership and control information, in a timely manner, to
  6 30 a requesting law enforcement authority upon receiving an
  6 31 appropriate request from the authority. Such information must
  6 32 include all of the following: the names and addresses of
  6 33 current interest holders and known transferees; the governing
  6 34 jurisdiction of any current interest holder or transferee that
  6 35 is an entity; the names and addresses of current governing
  7  1 individuals; copies of government=issued identification
  7  2 documents of current governing individuals; records regarding
  7  3 the process by which governing individuals are elected;
  7  4 records regarding voting power; the names of the individuals
  7  5 responsible for producing the information; and a certification
  7  6 that the information provided is accurate, signed under penalty
  7  7 of perjury.
  7  8    The bill authorizes the district court to dissolve a
  7  9 domestic business entity in a proceeding brought by the
  7 10 attorney general if the entity materially fails to comply
  7 11 with an information request required under the bill. Venue
  7 12 for such a proceeding is in Polk county. A court in a
  7 13 proceeding brought to dissolve a domestic business entity
  7 14 may issue injunctions, appoint receivers or custodians, and
  7 15 take any other action needed. However, a court must hold a
  7 16 hearing prior to appointing a receiver. Such a receiver may
  7 17 be an individual or an entity authorized to do business in
  7 18 the state and may be required to post bond. The court must
  7 19 describe the receiver's powers and duties in its appointing
  7 20 order. The court may order the domestic business entity to
  7 21 compensate or reimburse the receiver for expenses from time to
  7 22 time. If after a hearing the court determines that grounds
  7 23 for dissolution exist, it may enter a decree dissolving the
  7 24 domestic business entity on a specific date, a certified copy
  7 25 of which is received and filed by the secretary of state. Such
  7 26 a domestic business entity must wind up and liquidate its
  7 27 business and affairs in accordance with Iowa law.
  7 28    The bill prohibits individuals responsible for producing
  7 29 information required under the bill from being held personally
  7 30 liable for producing the information after receiving an
  7 31 appropriate request or for any inaccuracies or omissions from
  7 32 the information produced, except if the individual acts with
  7 33 recklessness or the individual's act involves intentional
  7 34 misconduct or criminal conduct. Interest holders, transferees,
  7 35 and governing individuals cannot be held personally liable for
  8  1 a domestic business entity's compliance or noncompliance with
  8  2 the bill.
  8  3    The bill adds certifying a copy of a decree of dissolution
  8  4 of a domestic business entity to the secretary of state to
  8  5 the list of general duties for the office of the clerk of the
  8  6 district court in Code section 602.8102.

  7 23 for dissolution exist, it may enter a decree dissolving the

  7 25 of which is received and filed by the secretary of state. Such
  7 26 a domestic business entity must wind up and liquidate its
  7 27 business and affairs in accordance with Iowa law.
  7 28    The bill prohibits individuals responsible for producing
  7 29 information required under the bill from being held personally
  7 30 liable for producing the information after receiving an
  7 31 appropriate request or for any inaccuracies or omissions from

  7 35 and governing individuals cannot be held personally liable for
  8  1 a domestic business entity's compliance or noncompliance with

  5 29    This bill provides law enforcement authorities with access
  5 30 to the ownership and control information of domestic business
  5 31 entities.
  5 32    The bill includes several definitions. The bill defines
  5 33 "appropriate request" to mean a civil, criminal, or
  5 34 administrative subpoena or summons from any state, local, or
  5 35 federal law enforcement authority. "Domestic business entity"
  6  1 is defined as a business entity organized under Iowa law that
  6  2 has no more than 50 interest holders on the effective date of
  6  3 its corporate or organizational existence, including but not
  6  4 limited to limited liability companies, corporations, nonprofit
  6  5 corporations, partnerships, limited partnerships, limited
  6  6 liability partnerships, limited liability limited partnerships,
  6  7 cooperative associations, and cooperatives. However, the
  6  8 definition of "domestic business entity" does not include any
  6  9 of the following: entities licensed to do business as banks
  6 10 or other depository institutions, trust companies, insurance
  6 11 companies, or securities or commodities brokers; entities
  6 12 registered as investment companies under federal law; entities
  6 13 registered as investment advisors under federal law; entities
  6 14 controlled by or under the control of any entity not included
  6 15 in the definition of "domestic business entity"; or entities
  6 16 registered as exempt organizations by the internal revenue
  6 17 service. "Governing individual" is defined as an individual
  6 18 who is designated to be responsible for governing a domestic
  6 19 business entity, including but not limited to directors and
  6 20 general partners. "Interest holder" is defined as a person who
  6 21 holds an interest in a domestic business entity, including but
  6 22 not limited to shareholders, general or limited partners, or
  6 23 members. "Person" is the same as defined in Code section 4.1.
  6 24 "Transferable interest" is defined as an interest holder's
  6 25 right to receive distributions. "Transferee" is defined as a
  6 26 person to which all or part of a transferable interest has been
  6 27 transferred.
  6 28    The bill requires a domestic business entity to provide
  6 29 ownership and control information, in a timely manner, to
  6 30 a requesting law enforcement authority upon receiving an
  6 31 appropriate request from the authority. Such information must
  6 32 include all of the following: the names and addresses of
  6 33 current interest holders and known transferees; the governing
  6 34 jurisdiction of any current interest holder or transferee that
  6 35 is an entity; the names and addresses of current governing
  7  1 individuals; copies of government=issued identification
  7  2 documents of current governing individuals; records regarding
  7  3 the process by which governing individuals are elected;
  7  4 records regarding voting power; the names of the individuals
  7  5 responsible for producing the information; and a certification
  7  6 that the information provided is accurate, signed under penalty
  7  7 of perjury.
  7  8    The bill authorizes the district court to dissolve a
  7  9 domestic business entity in a proceeding brought by the
  7 10 attorney general if the entity materially fails to comply
  7 11 with an information request required under the bill. Venue
  7 12 for such a proceeding is in Polk county. A court in a
  7 13 proceeding brought to dissolve a domestic business entity
  7 14 may issue injunctions, appoint receivers or custodians, and
  7 15 take any other action needed. However, a court must hold a
  7 16 hearing prior to appointing a receiver. Such a receiver may
  7 17 be an individual or an entity authorized to do business in
  7 18 the state and may be required to post bond. The court must
  7 19 describe the receiver's powers and duties in its appointing
  7 20 order. The court may order the domestic business entity to
  7 21 compensate or reimburse the receiver for expenses from time to
  7 22 time. If after a hearing the court determines that grounds
  7 23 for dissolution exist, it may enter a decree dissolving the
  7 24 domestic business entity on a specific date, a certified copy
  7 25 of which is received and filed by the secretary of state. Such
  7 26 a domestic business entity must wind up and liquidate its
  7 27 business and affairs in accordance with Iowa law.
  7 28    The bill prohibits individuals responsible for producing
  7 29 information required under the bill from being held personally
  7 30 liable for producing the information after receiving an
  7 31 appropriate request or for any inaccuracies or omissions from
  7 32 the information produced, except if the individual acts with
  7 33 recklessness or the individual's act involves intentional
  7 34 misconduct or criminal conduct. Interest holders, transferees,
  7 35 and governing individuals cannot be held personally liable for
  8  1 a domestic business entity's compliance or noncompliance with
  8  2 the bill.
  8  3    The bill adds certifying a copy of a decree of dissolution
  8  4 of a domestic business entity to the secretary of state to
  8  5 the list of general duties for the office of the clerk of the
  8  6 district court in Code section 602.8102.
