  4 18                           EXPLANATION
  4 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 21    This bill requires a local law enforcement agency to
  4 22 provide an individual in the agency's custody with a written
  4 23 notification form in advance of any interview between
  4 24 the individual and United States immigration and customs
  4 25 enforcement regarding a civil immigration violation. The bill
  4 26 provides that the form shall include an explanation of the
  4 27 purpose of the interview, that the interview is voluntary, and
  4 28 that the individual may decline to be interviewed or may choose
  4 29 to be interviewed only with the individual's attorney present.
  4 30 The bill provides for the translation of the form into an
  4 31 individual's native language.
  4 32    The bill requires a local law enforcement agency, upon
  4 33 receiving a hold, notification, or transfer request from United
  4 34 States immigration and customs enforcement, to provide a copy
  4 35 of the request to the individual who is the subject of the
  5  1 request and inform the individual whether the agency intends
  5  2 to comply with the request. The bill requires a local law
  5  3 enforcement agency that provides United States immigration
  5  4 and customs enforcement with notification that an individual
  5  5 is being or will be released from custody on a certain date
  5  6 to promptly provide the same notification in writing to the
  5  7 individual and to either the individual's attorney or one
  5  8 additional person who the individual may designate.
  5  9    Beginning January 1, 2019, the bill requires the governing
  5 10 body of any county or city of which a local law enforcement
  5 11 agency has provided immigration and customs enforcement
  5 12 access to an individual during the last year to hold at least
  5 13 one community forum during the following year. The local
  5 14 law enforcement agency shall utilize the community forum to
  5 15 provide information to the public about immigration and customs
  5 16 enforcement access to individuals in the county or city and to
  5 17 receive and consider public comment. The bill authorizes a law
  5 18 enforcement agency to provide the governing body of the county
  5 19 or city with data the agency maintains regarding the number and
  5 20 demographic characteristics of individuals to whom the agency
  5 21 has provided immigration and customs enforcement access as part
  5 22 of the community forum.
  5 23    The bill provides that all records relating to immigration
  5 24 and customs enforcement access to individuals provided by local
  5 25 law enforcement agencies, including all communication with
  5 26 United States immigration and customs enforcement, shall be
  5 27 public records subject to the provisions of Code chapter 22,
  5 28 the state public records law.
  5 29    The bill shall not be construed to provide, expand, or ratify
  5 30 the legal authority of any state or local law enforcement
  5 31 agency to detain an individual based upon a United States
  5 32 immigration and customs enforcement hold request.
  5 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  5 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  5 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  6  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  6  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  6  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  6  4 mandate included in the bill.
