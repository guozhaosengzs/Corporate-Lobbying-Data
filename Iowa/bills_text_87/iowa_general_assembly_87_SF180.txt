  1 23    Sec. 3.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
  1 24    1.  The general assembly finds and declares the following:
  1 25    a.  That the state of Iowa faces a critical shortage of

  1 28 in chapter 15B is intended to improve the skills of Iowa's

  1 31    c.  That the amount of financial assistance available under
  1 32 the program should be calculated solely based on the number of
  1 33 apprentices who are Iowa residents because Iowa residency is an

  2  1 solely based on Iowa residency in order to improve Iowa's
  2  2 workforce is a legitimate governmental purpose.
  2  3    e.  That the financial assistance available under the
  2  4 program is intended to be a statutory benefit and that the
  2  5 statute is not intended to bind the state either by creating a
  2  6 contractual right or a vested right.
  2  7    2.  The general assembly further declares that the purposes
