 58 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 58 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 58 31    This bill strikes provisions relating to the creation of the
 58 32 college student aid commission and transfers the duties and
 58 33 responsibilities over Code chapter 261, administering student

 59 21 aid commission for the registration of postsecondary schools

 58 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 58 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 58 31    This bill strikes provisions relating to the creation of the
 58 32 college student aid commission and transfers the duties and
 58 33 responsibilities over Code chapter 261, administering student
 58 34 financial aid programs, and Code chapter 261B, registering

 59  4 provision creating the scholarship and tuition grant reserve
 59  5 fund from Code section 261.20 to Code section 261.4, and
 59  6 eliminates the word "tuition" from the provision to reflect
 59  7 the multiple grants programs administered under Code chapter
 59  8 261. The bill allows the treasurer of state to enter into an
 59  9 agreement with the department of revenue to collect defaulted
 59 10 student debt.

 59 13 to initiate action to deny, revoke, or suspend any license
 59 14 authorized by state law, to any person who defaulted on an
 59 15 obligation owed or collected by the commission. Provisions
 59 16 relating to the minority academic grants for economic success

 59 18 of regents currently administers the program.
 59 19    DIVISION II == POSTSECONDARY REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS.  The
 59 20 bill transfers the powers and duties of the college student
 59 21 aid commission for the registration of postsecondary schools
 59 22 to the treasurer of state, including oversight functions over
 59 23 the advertising, financial responsibility, tuition refund, and
 59 24 disclosure requirements and restrictions governing certain
 59 25 educational programs and courses under Code chapter 714.
 59 26    DIVISION III == MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.  The bill also
 59 27 includes transitional provisions relating to the transfer of
 59 28 employees from the commission to the office of the treasurer
 59 29 of state, the validity of awards made by the commission prior
 59 30 to the effective date of the bill, cooperation with federal
 59 31 agencies, transfer of funds, and enforcement actions.
 59 32    The bill includes a number of conforming amendments.

 58 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 58 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 58 31    This bill strikes provisions relating to the creation of the
 58 32 college student aid commission and transfers the duties and
 58 33 responsibilities over Code chapter 261, administering student

 59 21 aid commission for the registration of postsecondary schools

 58 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 58 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 58 31    This bill strikes provisions relating to the creation of the
 58 32 college student aid commission and transfers the duties and
 58 33 responsibilities over Code chapter 261, administering student
 58 34 financial aid programs, and Code chapter 261B, registering

 59  1 DIVISION I == TRANSFER OF COMMISSION DUTIES.  The bill
 59  2 provides to the treasurer of state the powers and duties

 59  4 provision creating the scholarship and tuition grant reserve
 59  5 fund from Code section 261.20 to Code section 261.4, and
 59  6 eliminates the word "tuition" from the provision to reflect
 59  7 the multiple grants programs administered under Code chapter
 59  8 261. The bill allows the treasurer of state to enter into an
 59  9 agreement with the department of revenue to collect defaulted
 59 10 student debt.

 59 13 to initiate action to deny, revoke, or suspend any license
 59 14 authorized by state law, to any person who defaulted on an
 59 15 obligation owed or collected by the commission. Provisions
 59 16 relating to the minority academic grants for economic success
 59 17 are transferred to new Code section 262.83, as the state board
 59 18 of regents currently administers the program.
 59 19    DIVISION II == POSTSECONDARY REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS.  The
 59 20 bill transfers the powers and duties of the college student
 59 21 aid commission for the registration of postsecondary schools
 59 22 to the treasurer of state, including oversight functions over
 59 23 the advertising, financial responsibility, tuition refund, and
 59 24 disclosure requirements and restrictions governing certain
 59 25 educational programs and courses under Code chapter 714.
 59 26    DIVISION III == MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.  The bill also
 59 27 includes transitional provisions relating to the transfer of
 59 28 employees from the commission to the office of the treasurer
 59 29 of state, the validity of awards made by the commission prior
 59 30 to the effective date of the bill, cooperation with federal
 59 31 agencies, transfer of funds, and enforcement actions.
 59 32    The bill includes a number of conforming amendments.

 58 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 58 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 58 31    This bill strikes provisions relating to the creation of the
 58 32 college student aid commission and transfers the duties and
 58 33 responsibilities over Code chapter 261, administering student
 58 34 financial aid programs, and Code chapter 261B, registering
 58 35 postsecondary schools, to the office of the treasurer of state.
 59  1 DIVISION I == TRANSFER OF COMMISSION DUTIES.  The bill
 59  2 provides to the treasurer of state the powers and duties
 59  3 necessary to administer Code chapter 261.  The bill moves a
 59  4 provision creating the scholarship and tuition grant reserve
 59  5 fund from Code section 261.20 to Code section 261.4, and
 59  6 eliminates the word "tuition" from the provision to reflect
 59  7 the multiple grants programs administered under Code chapter
 59  8 261. The bill allows the treasurer of state to enter into an
 59  9 agreement with the department of revenue to collect defaulted
 59 10 student debt.
 59 11    Because of changes in federal law, the bill repeals
 59 12 provisions that authorized the college student aid commission
 59 13 to initiate action to deny, revoke, or suspend any license
 59 14 authorized by state law, to any person who defaulted on an
 59 15 obligation owed or collected by the commission. Provisions
 59 16 relating to the minority academic grants for economic success
 59 17 are transferred to new Code section 262.83, as the state board
 59 18 of regents currently administers the program.
 59 19    DIVISION II == POSTSECONDARY REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS.  The
 59 20 bill transfers the powers and duties of the college student
 59 21 aid commission for the registration of postsecondary schools
 59 22 to the treasurer of state, including oversight functions over
 59 23 the advertising, financial responsibility, tuition refund, and
 59 24 disclosure requirements and restrictions governing certain
 59 25 educational programs and courses under Code chapter 714.
 59 26    DIVISION III == MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.  The bill also
 59 27 includes transitional provisions relating to the transfer of
 59 28 employees from the commission to the office of the treasurer
 59 29 of state, the validity of awards made by the commission prior
 59 30 to the effective date of the bill, cooperation with federal
 59 31 agencies, transfer of funds, and enforcement actions.
