  9  4                           EXPLANATION
  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill provides for the registration of all=terrain
  9  8 vehicles for operation on certain Iowa roads.
  9  9    Code section 321.1 defines "all=terrain vehicle" as a motor
  9 10 vehicle designed to travel on three or more wheels and designed
  9 11 primarily for off=road recreational use.  The definition
  9 12 includes off=road utility vehicles, but excludes farm tractors
  9 13 or equipment, construction equipment, forestry vehicles,
  9 14 and lawn and grounds maintenance vehicles.  Currently, the
  9 15 department of natural resources regulates all=terrain vehicles
  9 16 for purposes of off=road recreational use.  All=terrain
  9 17 vehicles are not permitted on Iowa roads, except under limited
  9 18 circumstances.
  9 19    Under the bill, the owner of an all=terrain vehicle designed
  9 20 to travel on four or more wheels may register the vehicle
  9 21 with the department of transportation through the county
  9 22 treasurer.  The annual registration fee is $50.  The size
  9 23 of license plates to be issued for all=terrain vehicles will
  9 24 be determined by the department of transportation.  Because
  9 25 all=terrain vehicles are currently subject to sales tax,
  9 26 the bill provides that all=terrain vehicles are exempt from
  9 27 the fee for new registration imposed on vehicles subject to
  9 28 registration, so long as the owner has paid the Iowa sales
  9 29 tax or the appropriate tax in another state at the time of
  9 30 purchase. If an all=terrain vehicle is exempt from sales tax,
  9 31 the vehicle is also exempt from the fee for new registration.
  9 32 Registration with the department of transportation does not
  9 33 exempt the owner from the current requirement to register the
  9 34 all=terrain vehicle with the department of natural resources,
  9 35 and the department of natural resources will continue to
 10  1 issue certificates of title for all=terrain vehicles.  The
 10  2 bill requires an applicant for registration of an all=terrain
 10  3 vehicle with the department of transportation to present a
 10  4 copy of the registration receipt issued by the department of
 10  5 natural resources containing a description of the vehicle and
 10  6 identifying the applicant as the owner of the vehicle.  The
 10  7 bill specifies that a manufacturer's label certifying that the
 10  8 vehicle meets federal motor vehicle safety standards is not
 10  9 required for registration of an all=terrain vehicle with the
 10 10 department of transportation, and current provisions under

 10 17 with the department of transportation may be operated on
 10 18 secondary roads, but not on primary highways, except to
 10 19 cross over a primary highway, and not on highways within the

 11 12 continue the applicability of the sales tax to those vehicles.
 11 13    Under current law, a person who operates an all=terrain
 11 14 vehicle on a highway in violation of current restrictions
 11 15 commits a simple misdemeanor punishable by a scheduled fine
 11 16 of $50.  The bill establishes the same penalty for a person
 11 17 who operates a registered all=terrain vehicle in violation of
 11 18 minimum age and licensing requirements or on a highway where
 11 19 all=terrain vehicle operation is not authorized.
 11 20    The bill makes conforming amendments to Code chapter

  9  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9  7    This bill provides for the registration of all=terrain
  9  8 vehicles for operation on certain Iowa roads.
  9  9    Code section 321.1 defines "all=terrain vehicle" as a motor
  9 10 vehicle designed to travel on three or more wheels and designed
  9 11 primarily for off=road recreational use.  The definition
  9 12 includes off=road utility vehicles, but excludes farm tractors
  9 13 or equipment, construction equipment, forestry vehicles,
  9 14 and lawn and grounds maintenance vehicles.  Currently, the
  9 15 department of natural resources regulates all=terrain vehicles
  9 16 for purposes of off=road recreational use.  All=terrain
  9 17 vehicles are not permitted on Iowa roads, except under limited
  9 18 circumstances.
  9 19    Under the bill, the owner of an all=terrain vehicle designed
  9 20 to travel on four or more wheels may register the vehicle
  9 21 with the department of transportation through the county
  9 22 treasurer.  The annual registration fee is $50.  The size
  9 23 of license plates to be issued for all=terrain vehicles will
  9 24 be determined by the department of transportation.  Because
  9 25 all=terrain vehicles are currently subject to sales tax,
  9 26 the bill provides that all=terrain vehicles are exempt from
  9 27 the fee for new registration imposed on vehicles subject to
  9 28 registration, so long as the owner has paid the Iowa sales
  9 29 tax or the appropriate tax in another state at the time of
  9 30 purchase. If an all=terrain vehicle is exempt from sales tax,
  9 31 the vehicle is also exempt from the fee for new registration.
  9 32 Registration with the department of transportation does not
  9 33 exempt the owner from the current requirement to register the
  9 34 all=terrain vehicle with the department of natural resources,
  9 35 and the department of natural resources will continue to
 10  1 issue certificates of title for all=terrain vehicles.  The
 10  2 bill requires an applicant for registration of an all=terrain
 10  3 vehicle with the department of transportation to present a
 10  4 copy of the registration receipt issued by the department of
 10  5 natural resources containing a description of the vehicle and
 10  6 identifying the applicant as the owner of the vehicle.  The
 10  7 bill specifies that a manufacturer's label certifying that the
 10  8 vehicle meets federal motor vehicle safety standards is not
 10  9 required for registration of an all=terrain vehicle with the
 10 10 department of transportation, and current provisions under
 10 11 the purview of the department of transportation relating to
 10 12 the regulation of motor vehicle dealers, manufacturers, and
 10 13 distributors or to the sale, rental, lease, transfer, or
 10 14 disposition of motor vehicles do not apply to all=terrain
 10 15 vehicles.
 10 16    The bill provides that an all=terrain vehicle registered
 10 17 with the department of transportation may be operated on
 10 18 secondary roads, but not on primary highways, except to
 10 19 cross over a primary highway, and not on highways within the
 10 20 corporate limits of a city except where all=terrain vehicles
 10 21 are permitted by ordinance.  Under the bill, a city may
 10 22 authorize the operation of all=terrain vehicles registered
 10 23 with the department of transportation on highways under the

 10 26 321I that allow cities and counties to designate roads under
 10 27 their jurisdiction for the operation of all=terrain vehicles

 10 29    The bill states that a person who operates an all=terrain
 10 30 vehicle on a highway must be at least 16 years of age and have
 10 31 a valid driver's license other than a license valid only for

 11  2 vehicle financial liability coverage, and the all=terrain
 11  3 vehicle must meet requirements for headlamps, rear lamps,

 11  5 vehicles operated on a highway, except that an all=terrain
 11  6 vehicle may not be operated at a speed exceeding 45 miles per
 11  7 hour.
 11  8    The bill amends the definition of "vehicles subject to
 11  9 registration" for purposes of the exemption from the sales and
 11 10 use tax, to exclude all=terrain vehicles and off=road utility
 11 11 vehicles registered for operation on highways, in order to
 11 12 continue the applicability of the sales tax to those vehicles.
 11 13    Under current law, a person who operates an all=terrain
 11 14 vehicle on a highway in violation of current restrictions
 11 15 commits a simple misdemeanor punishable by a scheduled fine
 11 16 of $50.  The bill establishes the same penalty for a person
 11 17 who operates a registered all=terrain vehicle in violation of
 11 18 minimum age and licensing requirements or on a highway where
 11 19 all=terrain vehicle operation is not authorized.

  9  9    Code section 321.1 defines "all=terrain vehicle" as a motor
  9 10 vehicle designed to travel on three or more wheels and designed
  9 11 primarily for off=road recreational use.  The definition
  9 12 includes off=road utility vehicles, but excludes farm tractors
  9 13 or equipment, construction equipment, forestry vehicles,
  9 14 and lawn and grounds maintenance vehicles.  Currently, the
  9 15 department of natural resources regulates all=terrain vehicles
  9 16 for purposes of off=road recreational use.  All=terrain
  9 17 vehicles are not permitted on Iowa roads, except under limited
  9 18 circumstances.
  9 19    Under the bill, the owner of an all=terrain vehicle designed
  9 20 to travel on four or more wheels may register the vehicle
  9 21 with the department of transportation through the county
  9 22 treasurer.  The annual registration fee is $50.  The size
  9 23 of license plates to be issued for all=terrain vehicles will
  9 24 be determined by the department of transportation.  Because
  9 25 all=terrain vehicles are currently subject to sales tax,
  9 26 the bill provides that all=terrain vehicles are exempt from
  9 27 the fee for new registration imposed on vehicles subject to
  9 28 registration, so long as the owner has paid the Iowa sales
  9 29 tax or the appropriate tax in another state at the time of
  9 30 purchase. If an all=terrain vehicle is exempt from sales tax,
  9 31 the vehicle is also exempt from the fee for new registration.
  9 32 Registration with the department of transportation does not
  9 33 exempt the owner from the current requirement to register the
  9 34 all=terrain vehicle with the department of natural resources,
  9 35 and the department of natural resources will continue to
 10  1 issue certificates of title for all=terrain vehicles.  The
 10  2 bill requires an applicant for registration of an all=terrain
 10  3 vehicle with the department of transportation to present a
 10  4 copy of the registration receipt issued by the department of
 10  5 natural resources containing a description of the vehicle and
 10  6 identifying the applicant as the owner of the vehicle.  The
 10  7 bill specifies that a manufacturer's label certifying that the
 10  8 vehicle meets federal motor vehicle safety standards is not
 10  9 required for registration of an all=terrain vehicle with the
 10 10 department of transportation, and current provisions under
 10 11 the purview of the department of transportation relating to
 10 12 the regulation of motor vehicle dealers, manufacturers, and
 10 13 distributors or to the sale, rental, lease, transfer, or
 10 14 disposition of motor vehicles do not apply to all=terrain
 10 15 vehicles.
 10 16    The bill provides that an all=terrain vehicle registered
 10 17 with the department of transportation may be operated on
 10 18 secondary roads, but not on primary highways, except to
 10 19 cross over a primary highway, and not on highways within the
 10 20 corporate limits of a city except where all=terrain vehicles
 10 21 are permitted by ordinance.  Under the bill, a city may
 10 22 authorize the operation of all=terrain vehicles registered
 10 23 with the department of transportation on highways under the
 10 24 city's jurisdiction other than municipal extensions of primary
 10 25 highways. The bill strikes current provisions in Code chapter
 10 26 321I that allow cities and counties to designate roads under
 10 27 their jurisdiction for the operation of all=terrain vehicles
 10 28 registered with the department of natural resources.
 10 29    The bill states that a person who operates an all=terrain
 10 30 vehicle on a highway must be at least 16 years of age and have
 10 31 a valid driver's license other than a license valid only for
 10 32 the operation of a motorized bicycle.  Iowa motor vehicle laws
 10 33 apply to the operation of all=terrain vehicles on highways
 10 34 except those equipment provisions which by their nature can
 10 35 have no practical application.  The bill specifies that the
 11  1 operator of an all=terrain vehicle must carry proof of motor
 11  2 vehicle financial liability coverage, and the all=terrain
 11  3 vehicle must meet requirements for headlamps, rear lamps,
 11  4 and turn signals.  Current speed limits apply to all=terrain
 11  5 vehicles operated on a highway, except that an all=terrain
 11  6 vehicle may not be operated at a speed exceeding 45 miles per
 11  7 hour.
 11  8    The bill amends the definition of "vehicles subject to
 11  9 registration" for purposes of the exemption from the sales and
 11 10 use tax, to exclude all=terrain vehicles and off=road utility
 11 11 vehicles registered for operation on highways, in order to
 11 12 continue the applicability of the sales tax to those vehicles.
 11 13    Under current law, a person who operates an all=terrain
 11 14 vehicle on a highway in violation of current restrictions
 11 15 commits a simple misdemeanor punishable by a scheduled fine
 11 16 of $50.  The bill establishes the same penalty for a person
 11 17 who operates a registered all=terrain vehicle in violation of
 11 18 minimum age and licensing requirements or on a highway where
 11 19 all=terrain vehicle operation is not authorized.
 11 20    The bill makes conforming amendments to Code chapter
 11 21 321I, relating to the regulation of all=terrain vehicles by
 11 22 the department of natural resources. The bill also amends
 11 23 definitions in Code chapters applicable to motor vehicle
 11 24 dealers, motor vehicle franchisers, the leasing and renting
 11 25 of motor vehicles, vehicle recyclers, motor vehicle service
 11 26 contracts, and motor vehicle service trade practices, to

  9 16 for purposes of off=road recreational use.  All=terrain
  9 17 vehicles are not permitted on Iowa roads, except under limited
  9 18 circumstances.
  9 19    Under the bill, the owner of an all=terrain vehicle designed

 11  2 vehicle financial liability coverage, and the all=terrain
 11  3 vehicle must meet requirements for headlamps, rear lamps,

  9 19    Under the bill, the owner of an all=terrain vehicle designed
  9 20 to travel on four or more wheels may register the vehicle
  9 21 with the department of transportation through the county
  9 22 treasurer.  The annual registration fee is $50.  The size
  9 23 of license plates to be issued for all=terrain vehicles will
  9 24 be determined by the department of transportation.  Because
  9 25 all=terrain vehicles are currently subject to sales tax,
  9 26 the bill provides that all=terrain vehicles are exempt from
  9 27 the fee for new registration imposed on vehicles subject to
  9 28 registration, so long as the owner has paid the Iowa sales
  9 29 tax or the appropriate tax in another state at the time of
  9 30 purchase. If an all=terrain vehicle is exempt from sales tax,
  9 31 the vehicle is also exempt from the fee for new registration.
  9 32 Registration with the department of transportation does not
  9 33 exempt the owner from the current requirement to register the
  9 34 all=terrain vehicle with the department of natural resources,
  9 35 and the department of natural resources will continue to
 10  1 issue certificates of title for all=terrain vehicles.  The
 10  2 bill requires an applicant for registration of an all=terrain
 10  3 vehicle with the department of transportation to present a
 10  4 copy of the registration receipt issued by the department of
 10  5 natural resources containing a description of the vehicle and
 10  6 identifying the applicant as the owner of the vehicle.  The
 10  7 bill specifies that a manufacturer's label certifying that the
 10  8 vehicle meets federal motor vehicle safety standards is not
 10  9 required for registration of an all=terrain vehicle with the
 10 10 department of transportation, and current provisions under

 10 14 disposition of motor vehicles do not apply to all=terrain
 10 15 vehicles.
 10 16    The bill provides that an all=terrain vehicle registered
 10 17 with the department of transportation may be operated on
 10 18 secondary roads, but not on primary highways, except to
 10 19 cross over a primary highway, and not on highways within the
 10 20 corporate limits of a city except where all=terrain vehicles
 10 21 are permitted by ordinance.  Under the bill, a city may
 10 22 authorize the operation of all=terrain vehicles registered
 10 23 with the department of transportation on highways under the

 10 32 the operation of a motorized bicycle.  Iowa motor vehicle laws
 10 33 apply to the operation of all=terrain vehicles on highways
 10 34 except those equipment provisions which by their nature can
 10 35 have no practical application.  The bill specifies that the
 11  1 operator of an all=terrain vehicle must carry proof of motor
 11  2 vehicle financial liability coverage, and the all=terrain
 11  3 vehicle must meet requirements for headlamps, rear lamps,
 11  4 and turn signals.  Current speed limits apply to all=terrain
 11  5 vehicles operated on a highway, except that an all=terrain
 11  6 vehicle may not be operated at a speed exceeding 45 miles per
 11  7 hour.
