  5 23 tax to the owner or operator of a raceway facility that meets
  5 24 certain requirements.  The rebate is available for two types of

  5 28 of a project at the raceway facility.  The rebate related to
  5 29 the completion of a project is limited to one project per
  5 30 raceway facility.  The rebates only apply to transactions
  5 31 occurring between January 1, 2015, and January 1, 2025.  The
  5 32 maximum amount of rebates is limited to $2 million or 25
  5 33 percent of the project costs if such a project is undertaken at

  5 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 22    BACKGROUND.  Current law provides a rebate of sales and use
  5 23 tax to the owner or operator of a raceway facility that meets
  5 24 certain requirements.  The rebate is available for two types of
  5 25 transactions.  The first type is for state sales tax collected
  5 26 on purchases made at the raceway facility.  The second type is
  5 27 for state sales or use tax paid by a contractor in completion
  5 28 of a project at the raceway facility.  The rebate related to
  5 29 the completion of a project is limited to one project per
  5 30 raceway facility.  The rebates only apply to transactions
  5 31 occurring between January 1, 2015, and January 1, 2025.  The
  5 32 maximum amount of rebates is limited to $2 million or 25
  5 33 percent of the project costs if such a project is undertaken at
  5 34 the raceway facility, whichever is less.

  6  1 rebate for state sales or use tax paid by a contractor in
  6  2 completion of a project at the raceway facility, and strikes

  6  5 for state sales tax collected on purchases made at the raceway
  6  6 facility.  The bill also amends the maximum rebate limit to
  6  7 equal $1.8 million.
  6  8    The bill also provides that a claim for rebate of sales tax
  6  9 relating to sales occurring prior to the enactment of the bill
  6 10 will be considered timely if it is filed with the department
  6 11 of revenue within 90 days of the enactment date of the bill,
