 11  7    1.  The section of this Act enacting section 99E.9.
 11  8                           EXPLANATION
 11  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 11    This bill authorizes internet fantasy sports contests
 11 12 and provides for the licensing, regulation, and taxation of
 11 13 internet fantasy sports contests.
 11 14    New Code section 99E.1 provides for definitions. A "fantasy
 11 15 sports contest" is defined as any fantasy or simulated game
 11 16 or contest in which all prizes and awards offered to winning
 11 17 participants are established and made known in advance of the
 11 18 contest, all winning outcomes reflect the relative knowledge
 11 19 and skill of the participants and are determined predominantly
 11 20 by accumulated statistical results of the performance of
 11 21 individuals, and no winning outcome is based on the score, or
 11 22 performance of any single actual team or combination of such
 11 23 teams or solely on any single performance of an individual
 11 24 athlete in any single actual sporting or other event.  An
 11 25 "internet fantasy sports contest" is defined as a method of
 11 26 entering a fantasy sports contest by establishing an account
 11 27 with an internet fantasy sports contest service provider.  An
 11 28 "internet fantasy sports contest player" is defined as a person
 11 29 who is at least 21 years of age who participates in an internet
 11 30 fantasy sports contest.  The bill also defines internet fantasy
 11 31 sports contest adjusted revenues, internet fantasy sports
 11 32 contest service provider, and location percentage.
 11 33    New Code section 99E.2 provides that the system of entering
 11 34 an internet fantasy sports contest is legal when conducted by a
 11 35 licensed internet fantasy sports contest service provider as
 12  1 provided in the new Code chapter.
 12  2    New Code section 99E.3 establishes the powers of the racing
 12  3 and gaming commission in relation to internet fantasy sports
 12  4 contests and internet fantasy sports contest service providers.
 12  5 Specifically, the new Code section authorizes the commission
 12  6 to investigate and license internet fantasy sports contest
 12  7 service providers, assess fines and revoke or suspend licenses,
 12  8 impose penalties for violations of the new Code chapter, and
 12  9 take any other action to enforce the requirements of the new
 12 10 Code chapter.
 12 11    New Code section 99E.4 establishes the requirements for an
 12 12 applicant to be granted a license to conduct internet fantasy
 12 13 sports contests.  The Code section allows the commission
 12 14 to charge the applicant a fee for the department of public
 12 15 safety, division of criminal investigation, to defray the
 12 16 costs associated with any investigation.  The new Code
 12 17 section provides that a license shall not be issued if there
 12 18 is evidence that the applicant has failed to meet certain
 12 19 qualifying requirements.  A person who knowingly makes a
 12 20 false statement on the application is guilty of an aggravated
 12 21 misdemeanor.
 12 22    New Code section 99E.5 establishes the terms and conditions
 12 23 of licenses issued to conduct internet fantasy sports contests.
 12 24 The Code section provides that a license may be issued for
 12 25 a period of not more than three years and provides that
 12 26 the annual license fee shall be $500.  The new Code section
 12 27 also provides for the payment of a regulatory fee to be set
 12 28 by the racing and gaming commission based on the costs of
 12 29 administering and enforcing the new Code chapter.  The new
 12 30 Code section further provides that each licensee shall receive
 12 31 a credit for the amount of the regulatory fee paid against
 12 32 taxes to be paid pursuant to the new Code chapter. The new
 12 33 Code section provides that a licensed internet fantasy sports
 12 34 contest service provider shall prevent any employees and
 12 35 certain family members from participating in internet fantasy
 13  1 sports contests on the service provider's digital platform,
 13  2 verify that internet fantasy sports contest players located
 13  3 in this state are 21 or older, ensure that participants in
 13  4 a game or contest shall not be allowed to enter an internet
 13  5 fantasy sports contest involving that game or contest, prohibit
 13  6 internet fantasy sports contests based upon any interscholastic
 13  7 or intercollegiate athletic contest or any amateur athletic
 13  8 contest or competition in which all participants are under
 13  9 the age of 21, permit individuals to restrict themselves
 13 10 from entering an internet fantasy sports contest, perform an
 13 11 independent audit, and pay the tax imposed by the new Code
 13 12 chapter.
 13 13    New Code section 99E.6 provides for a tax of 7.5 percent
 13 14 to be imposed on internet fantasy sports contest adjusted
 13 15 revenues.  The bill defines, in new Code section 99E.1,
 13 16 internet fantasy sports contest adjusted revenues as the total
 13 17 of fees and charges collected, less winnings, in an internet
 13 18 fantasy sports contest multiplied by the percentage of fees
 13 19 and charges paid by participants who are located in this state
 13 20 in that contest.  The bill provides that of the revenues
 13 21 collected, an amount equal to .5 percent of internet fantasy
 13 22 sports contest adjusted revenues is transferred to a special
 13 23 revenue account in the general fund to be used, subject to an
 13 24 appropriation, by the department of public health for gambling
 13 25 treatment with the remainder of revenues collected to be
 13 26 deposited in the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund.
 13 27    New Code section 99E.7 provides that a person under the
 13 28 age of 21 shall not enter an internet fantasy sports contest.
 13 29 A person who violates this Code section commits a scheduled
 13 30 violation under Code section 805.8C and is subject to a $500
 13 31 fine.  Code section 805.8C is amended to reflect this violation
 13 32 and applicable fine.
 13 33    New Code section 99E.8 authorizes the division of criminal
 13 34 investigation of the department of public safety to investigate
 13 35 licensee compliance with the requirements of the new Code
 14  1 chapter.
 14  2    New Code section 99E.9 requires a licensee to offset
 14  3 account balance withdrawals of an internet fantasy sports
 14  4 contest player who is a debtor in an amount equal to or greater
 14  5 than $1,200, subject to the requirements of this new Code
 14  6 section.  The bill provides that this Code section shall not be
 14  7 implemented until July 1, 2019.
 14  8    New Code section 99E.10 provides that, in addition to any
 14  9 other penalty specified in the new Code chapter, a person who
 14 10 willfully fails to comply with the requirements of the Code
 14 11 chapter commits a class "D" felony and shall be barred for life
 14 12 from internet fantasy sports contests.
 14 13    Code section 232C.4, concerning emancipation orders and
 14 14 minors, is amended to reflect that an emancipated minor is
 14 15 subject to the age restrictions for internet fantasy sports
 14 16 contests.
 14 17    Code section 714B.10, concerning prize promotions, is
 14 18 amended to exempt internet fantasy sports contests from the
 14 19 Code chapter.
 14 20    The bill provides for the issuance of a transitional license
 14 21 by the racing and gaming commission to a person to conduct
 14 22 internet fantasy sports contests in this state if the person
 14 23 has been granted a license or registration by two or more other
 14 24 states to conduct internet fantasy sports contests.  The bill
 14 25 provides that the transitional license shall be valid until the
 14 26 earlier of the date the commission grants or denies a license
 14 27 to the person or twelve months from the date the commission
 14 28 accepts applications for issuance of a license.

 11 16 or contest in which all prizes and awards offered to winning
 11 17 participants are established and made known in advance of the
 11 18 contest, all winning outcomes reflect the relative knowledge
 11 19 and skill of the participants and are determined predominantly
 11 20 by accumulated statistical results of the performance of
 11 21 individuals, and no winning outcome is based on the score, or
 11 22 performance of any single actual team or combination of such
 11 23 teams or solely on any single performance of an individual
 11 24 athlete in any single actual sporting or other event.  An
