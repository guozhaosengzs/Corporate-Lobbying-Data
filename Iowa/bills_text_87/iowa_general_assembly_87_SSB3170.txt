_____


the
franchiser
will
pay
to
the
franchisee
for
such
warranty
1


services,
including
for
parts,
labor,
diagnostics,
and
other


2


related
services.
The
schedule
of
compensation
shall
also
3


specify
reasonable
time
periods
under
which
the
franchisee
is
4


required
to
perform
such
warranty
services.


5


(1)


In
determining
reasonable
amounts
for
parts,
the
6


franchiser
may
add
one
to
the
franchisee’s
average
percentage
7


markup,
which
is
the
percentage
difference
calculated
as
a
8


decimal
between
the
price
paid
by
the
franchisee
for
parts
and


9


the
price
at
which
parts
are
sold
by
the
franchisee
at
retail,
10


and
multiply
the
result
by
the
price
paid
by
the
franchisee
for


11


the
parts,
including
shipping
and
other
charges.
12


(2)
In
determining
reasonable
amounts
for
labor-related
13


warranty
services,
the
franchiser
shall
consider
the
prevailing


14


wage
rates
paid
by
other
franchisees
in
the
franchisee’s
15


community,
not
including
wage
rates
paid
for
the
performance
16


of
routine
maintenance
such
as
tire
service
or
oil
service.
17


The
franchiser
may
calculate
the
franchisee’s
labor
rate
by


18


dividing
the
total
amount
of
retail
sales
attributable
to
labor


19


for
warranty
services
by
the
number
of
hours
of
labor
spent
to
20


generate
the
retail
sales.


21


(3)
(a)
The
franchisee
may
establish
its
average
percentage
22


markup
for
parts
or
its
labor
rate
by
submitting
to
the


23


franchiser
copies
of
one
hundred
sequential
retail
service
24


orders
paid
by
the
franchisee’s
customers,
or
all
of
the
25


franchisee’s
retail
service
orders
paid
by
the
franchisee’s
26


customers
in
a
ninety-day
period,
whichever
is
less,
for
27


services
provided
within
the
previous
one-hundred-eighty-day

service
orders
attributable
to

such
as
tire
service
or

(b)


Within
thirty
days
of
receiving
the
franchisee’s
32


submission,
the
franchiser
may
choose
to
audit
the
submitted
33


orders.
The

The

franchiser
shall
have
the
burden
of
proof
to

If

The

in
determining
reasonable
amounts
5


for
parts,
the
franchiser
may
add
one
to
the
franchisee’s
6


average
percentage
markup,
which
is
the
percentage
difference
7


calculated
as
a

between

franchisee
for
parts
and
the

the

the
result
by

price
10


paid

12


The
bill
specifies
that
in
determining
reasonable
amounts
13


for
labor-related
warranty
services,
the

a

community
is
18


the
franchisee’s
area
of
responsibility
as
stipulated

attributable
21


to
labor
for
warranty
services
by
the
number
of
hours
of
labor
22


spent
to
generate
the

23


The
bill
provides
that
a
franchisee
may
establish
its
24


average

The

provides
that
the
franchiser
shall
have
the
10


burden
of
proof
to
establish
that
the
franchiser’s
denial
was
11


reasonable.
If

DIA
finds
the

was
not
reasonable,
12


the

the

The

rate
by
a

methodology,
or
by
requiring

including

The

A

The

states
that
a

if

the

the
