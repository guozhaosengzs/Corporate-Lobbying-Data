  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill relates to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles by
  5 15 governmental agencies and other persons.
  5 16    The bill defines "unmanned aerial vehicle" to mean an
  5 17 aircraft that is operated without the possibility of direct
  5 18 human intervention from within or on the aircraft.
  5 19    The bill defines "image" to mean any capturing of sound
  5 20 waves, thermal, infrared, ultraviolet, visible light, or other
  5 21 electromagnetic wave, odor, or other conditions existing on or
  5 22 about real property in this state or a person located on that
  5 23 property.
  5 24    The bill prohibits a governmental agency from using an
  5 25 unmanned aerial vehicle to capture an image or to receive or
  5 26 disclose an image acquired through the use of an unmanned
  5 27 aerial vehicle unless used under the following circumstances:
  5 28 the use is in connection with a search warrant, the use is
  5 29 related to the search for a criminal suspect, to provide
  5 30 support to another tactical operation, or for crowd monitoring,
  5 31 the use is based upon a reasonable belief that an emergency
  5 32 exists that threatens the life or safety of a person, or the
  5 33 use is on public property.
  5 34    If a governmental agency uses an unmanned aerial vehicle
  5 35 in an emergency, the bill requires the supervisory official
  6  1 of such an agency to file a sworn statement with the court
  6  2 detailing the grounds for using the unmanned aerial vehicle in
  6  3 the emergency within 48 hours of its use.  The bill specifies
  6  4 that if the supervisory official fails to file the sworn
  6  5 statement, the supervisory official is barred from future
  6  6 involvement with the agency's use of unmanned aerial vehicles,
  6  7 and the agency must seek approval from the applicable governing
  6  8 body for any future use of an unmanned aerial vehicle.
  6  9    The bill prohibits a governmental agency from archiving data
  6 10 captured or received through the use of an unmanned aerial
  6 11 vehicle unless the data is captured or received in connection
  6 12 with a search warrant, or during an emergency, but only for
  6 13 48 hours except upon entry of a court order requiring the
  6 14 archiving of the data for more than 48 hours.
  6 15    The bill requires that an unmanned aerial vehicle purchased
  6 16 by a state agency be approved by the general assembly prior to
  6 17 such an acquisition.  The acquisition of an unmanned aerial
  6 18 vehicle at the county, city, or local government level shall
  6 19 be approved by the board of supervisors, city council, or
  6 20 other supervisory legislative body that oversees the political
  6 21 subdivision.
  6 22    The bill prohibits a person from using an unmanned aerial
  6 23 vehicle to capture an image of an individual or private
  6 24 property with the intent to conduct surveillance, or to stalk,
  6 25 follow, or intimidate another person.  The bill allows a person
  6 26 using an unmanned aerial vehicle to capture an image of an
  6 27 individual if the individual is on public property or the
  6 28 person has received permission from the individual to capture
  6 29 or receive such an image.
  6 30    The bill prohibits a person from using an unmanned aerial
  6 31 vehicle equipped with an instrument that is capable of emitting
  6 32 a peculiar sound or excessive noise, spraying a liquid or gas,
  6 33 or dropping an object.  The bill allows an unmanned aerial
  6 34 vehicle to be equipped with such instruments if the person uses
  6 35 the unmanned aerial vehicle over the real property owned by the
  7  1 person or the person has permission from the owner or tenant of
  7  2 the real property to use an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped
  7  3 with such instruments.
  7  4    The bill allows an accredited postsecondary institution,
  7  5 other than a special security officer or security agency
  7  6 employed by or otherwise connected with the institution, to use
  7  7 an unmanned aerial vehicle to capture or receive an image for
  7  8 research purposes, or to retain or distribute such an image.
  7  9    The bill prohibits an unmanned aerial vehicle from being
  7 10 equipped with a dangerous weapon.  The bill defines "dangerous
  7 11 weapon" to mean the same as defined in Code section 702.7,
  7 12 but also includes an instrument or device designed to damage
  7 13 property.
  7 14    The bill does not apply to an operation, exercise, or mission
  7 15 of any branch of the United States military, or the Iowa
  7 16 national guard.
  7 17    Under the bill, each state agency and each political
  7 18 subdivision, if required to do so by the supervising
  7 19 legislative body of the political subdivision, that uses an
  7 20 unmanned aerial vehicle shall provide information related to
  7 21 the use of the unmanned aerial vehicle to the department of
  7 22 public safety by June 30, 2018, and every June 30 thereafter.
  7 23 The bill also requires the department of public safety to
  7 24 compile such information and file a report to the standing
  7 25 committees on government oversight by January 15, 2019, and
  7 26 every January 15 thereafter.
  7 27    A person who violates the bill commits an aggravated
  7 28 misdemeanor. If the violation causes serious injury the person
  7 29 commits a class "D" felony, and if the violation causes death
  7 30 the person commits a class "C" felony.
  7 31    An aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for
  7 32 no more than two years and a fine of at least $625 but not more
  7 33 than $6,250.  A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement
  7 34 for no more than five years and a fine of at least $750 but
  7 35 not more than $7,500.  A class "C" felony is punishable by
  8  1 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
  8  2 $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
  8  3    In addition, the bill specifies that a "course of conduct"
  8  4 without a legitimate purpose includes the use of an unmanned
  8  5 aerial vehicle for purposes of proving the criminal offense of
  8  6 stalking.
  8  7    The bill also specifies that a person who knowingly assists
  8  8 in providing an unmanned aerial vehicle to a person who commits
  8  9 or attempts to commit terrorism is guilty of soliciting or
  8 10 providing material support or resources for terrorism in
  8 11 violation of Code section 708A.4.
  8 12    The bill further provides, for purposes of violations
  8 13 under Code chapter 717A (offenses relating to agricultural
  8 14 production), a person "controls" or "enters" an animal facility
  8 15 or a crop operation property if the actions of the person
  8 16 include the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle.

  5 14    This bill relates to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles by
  5 15 governmental agencies and other persons.
  5 16    The bill defines "unmanned aerial vehicle" to mean an
  5 17 aircraft that is operated without the possibility of direct
  5 18 human intervention from within or on the aircraft.
  5 19    The bill defines "image" to mean any capturing of sound
  5 20 waves, thermal, infrared, ultraviolet, visible light, or other
  5 21 electromagnetic wave, odor, or other conditions existing on or
  5 22 about real property in this state or a person located on that
  5 23 property.
  5 24    The bill prohibits a governmental agency from using an
  5 25 unmanned aerial vehicle to capture an image or to receive or
  5 26 disclose an image acquired through the use of an unmanned
  5 27 aerial vehicle unless used under the following circumstances:
  5 28 the use is in connection with a search warrant, the use is
  5 29 related to the search for a criminal suspect, to provide
  5 30 support to another tactical operation, or for crowd monitoring,
  5 31 the use is based upon a reasonable belief that an emergency
  5 32 exists that threatens the life or safety of a person, or the
  5 33 use is on public property.
  5 34    If a governmental agency uses an unmanned aerial vehicle
  5 35 in an emergency, the bill requires the supervisory official
  6  1 of such an agency to file a sworn statement with the court
  6  2 detailing the grounds for using the unmanned aerial vehicle in
  6  3 the emergency within 48 hours of its use.  The bill specifies
  6  4 that if the supervisory official fails to file the sworn
  6  5 statement, the supervisory official is barred from future
  6  6 involvement with the agency's use of unmanned aerial vehicles,
  6  7 and the agency must seek approval from the applicable governing
  6  8 body for any future use of an unmanned aerial vehicle.
  6  9    The bill prohibits a governmental agency from archiving data
  6 10 captured or received through the use of an unmanned aerial
  6 11 vehicle unless the data is captured or received in connection
  6 12 with a search warrant, or during an emergency, but only for
  6 13 48 hours except upon entry of a court order requiring the
  6 14 archiving of the data for more than 48 hours.
  6 15    The bill requires that an unmanned aerial vehicle purchased

  6 26 using an unmanned aerial vehicle to capture an image of an
  6 27 individual if the individual is on public property or the
  6 28 person has received permission from the individual to capture
  6 29 or receive such an image.

  6 31 vehicle equipped with an instrument that is capable of emitting
  6 32 a peculiar sound or excessive noise, spraying a liquid or gas,
  6 33 or dropping an object.  The bill allows an unmanned aerial
  6 34 vehicle to be equipped with such instruments if the person uses
  6 35 the unmanned aerial vehicle over the real property owned by the
  7  1 person or the person has permission from the owner or tenant of
  7  2 the real property to use an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped
  7  3 with such instruments.

  7  5 other than a special security officer or security agency
  7  6 employed by or otherwise connected with the institution, to use
  7  7 an unmanned aerial vehicle to capture or receive an image for
  7  8 research purposes, or to retain or distribute such an image.
  7  9    The bill prohibits an unmanned aerial vehicle from being
  7 10 equipped with a dangerous weapon.  The bill defines "dangerous
  7 11 weapon" to mean the same as defined in Code section 702.7,
  7 12 but also includes an instrument or device designed to damage
  7 13 property.
  7 14    The bill does not apply to an operation, exercise, or mission
  7 15 of any branch of the United States military, or the Iowa
  7 16 national guard.

  7 18 subdivision, if required to do so by the supervising
  7 19 legislative body of the political subdivision, that uses an
  7 20 unmanned aerial vehicle shall provide information related to

  7 24 compile such information and file a report to the standing
  7 25 committees on government oversight by January 15, 2019, and
  7 26 every January 15 thereafter.

  7 28 misdemeanor. If the violation causes serious injury the person
  7 29 commits a class "D" felony, and if the violation causes death
  7 30 the person commits a class "C" felony.

  8  1 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
  8  2 $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
  8  3    In addition, the bill specifies that a "course of conduct"
  8  4 without a legitimate purpose includes the use of an unmanned
  8  5 aerial vehicle for purposes of proving the criminal offense of
  8  6 stalking.
  8  7    The bill also specifies that a person who knowingly assists
  8  8 in providing an unmanned aerial vehicle to a person who commits
  8  9 or attempts to commit terrorism is guilty of soliciting or
  8 10 providing material support or resources for terrorism in
  8 11 violation of Code section 708A.4.
  8 12    The bill further provides, for purposes of violations
  8 13 under Code chapter 717A (offenses relating to agricultural
  8 14 production), a person "controls" or "enters" an animal facility
