  1  1    Section 1.    1  1    Section 1.    1  2 promotion of responsible animal feeding operations.
  1  3    1.  a.  Findings.  The general assembly finds that important
  1  4 public interests are advanced by preserving and encouraging the
  1  5 expansion of responsible animal agricultural production in this
  1  6 state which provides employment opportunities in and economic
  1  7 growth for rural Iowa, contributes tax revenues to the state
  1  8 and to local communities, and protects our valuable natural
  1  9 resources.
  1 10    b.  Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to encourage
  1 11 persons involved in animal agriculture to adopt existing
  1 12 prudent and generally utilized management practices for their
  1 13 animal feeding operations, thereby enhancing the fundamental
  1 14 role of animal agriculture in this state by providing a
  1 15 reasonable level of protection to persons engaged in animal
  1 16 agricultural production from certain types of nuisance actions.
  1 17    c.  Declaration.  The general assembly has balanced all
  1 18 competing interests and declares its intent to preserve
  1 19 and enhance responsible animal agricultural production,
  1 20 specifically animal agricultural producers in this state
  1 21 who use existing prudent and generally utilized management
  1 22 practices reasonable for their animal feeding operations.
  1 23    2.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, an animal
  1 24 feeding operation, as defined in section 459.102, found to
  1 25 be a public or private nuisance under this chapter or under
  1 26 principles of common law, or found to interfere with another
  1 27 person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  1 28 property under any other cause of action, shall be conclusively
  1 29 presumed to be a permanent nuisance and not a temporary
  1 30 or continuing nuisance under principles of common law, and
  1 31 shall be subject to compensatory damages only as provided in
  1 32 subsection 3.
  1 33    3.  Compensatory damages awarded to a person bringing
  1 34 an action alleging that an animal feeding operation is a
  1 35 public or private nuisance, or an interference with another
  2  1 person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2  2 property under any other cause of action, shall not exceed the
  2  3 following:
  2  4    a.  The person's share of compensatory property damages due
  2  5 to any diminution in the fair market value of the person's real
  2  6 property proximately caused by the animal feeding operation.
  2  7 The fair market value of the real property is deemed to equal
  2  8 the price that a buyer who is willing but not compelled to
  2  9 buy and a seller who is willing but not compelled to sell
  2 10 would accept for the real property. The person's share of any
  2 11 compensatory property damages must be based on the person's
  2 12 share of the ownership interest in the real property.  For
  2 13 purposes of this section, ownership interest means holding
  2 14 legal or equitable title to real property in fee simple, as a
  2 15 life estate, or as a leasehold interest.
  2 16    b.  The person's compensatory damages due to the person's
  2 17 past, present, and future adverse health condition.  This
  2 18 determination shall be made utilizing only objective and
  2 19 documented medical evidence that the nuisance or interference
  2 20 with the comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2 21 property was the proximate cause of the person's adverse health
  2 22 condition.
  2 23    c.  The person's compensatory special damages proximately
  2 24 caused by the animal feeding operation, including without
  2 25 limitation, annoyance and the loss of comfortable use and
  2 26 enjoyment of real property.  However, the total damages
  2 27 awarded to a person who holds an ownership interest in the real
  2 28 property for which damages are awarded under this paragraph "c"
  2 29 shall not exceed one and one=half times the sum of any damages
  2 30 awarded to the person for the person's share of the total
  2 31 compensatory property damages awarded under paragraph "a" plus
  2 32 any compensatory damages awarded to the person under paragraph
  2 33 "b".
  2 34    4.  A person who alleges and fails to prove that an animal
  2 35 feeding operation is a public or private nuisance under this
  3  1 chapter or under principles of common law, or an interference
  3  2 with another person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the
  3  3 person's life or property under any other cause of action,
  3  4 shall be liable to the person against whom the cause of action
  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
  3  6 attorney fees incurred in the defense of the animal feeding
  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as
  3  9 court costs.
  3 10    5.  This section shall apply to an animal feeding operation
  3 11 in the same manner as section 657.11, subsection 4.
  3 12    6.  This section shall not apply if the person bringing
  3 13 the action proves that the public or private nuisance or
  3 14 interference with another person's comfortable use and
  3 15 enjoyment of the person's life or property under any other
  3 16 cause of action is proximately caused by any of the following:
  3 17    a.  The failure to comply with a federal statute or
  3 18 regulation or a state statute or rule which applies to the
  3 19 animal feeding operation.
  3 20    b.  The failure to use existing prudent generally utilized
  3 21 management practices reasonable for the animal feeding
  3 22 operation.
  3 23    7.  This section does not apply to a person during  the
  3 24 time in which the person is classified as a habitual violator
  3 25 pursuant to section 459.604.
  3 26    8.  This section does not apply to a cause of action that
  3 27 accrued prior to the effective date of this Act.
  3 28    Sec. 2.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act, being deemed of immediate
  3 29 importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.
  5 24    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  1 25 be a public or private nuisance under this chapter or under
  1 26 principles of common law, or found to interfere with another
  1 27 person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  1 28 property under any other cause of action, shall be conclusively
  1 29 presumed to be a permanent nuisance and not a temporary
  1 30 or continuing nuisance under principles of common law, and
  1 31 shall be subject to compensatory damages only as provided in
  1 32 subsection 3.
  1 33    3.  Compensatory damages awarded to a person bringing
  1 34 an action alleging that an animal feeding operation is a
  1 35 public or private nuisance, or an interference with another
  2  1 person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2  2 property under any other cause of action, shall not exceed the
  2  3 following:
  2  4    a.  The person's share of compensatory property damages due
  2  5 to any diminution in the fair market value of the person's real
  2  6 property proximately caused by the animal feeding operation.
  2  7 The fair market value of the real property is deemed to equal
  2  8 the price that a buyer who is willing but not compelled to
  2  9 buy and a seller who is willing but not compelled to sell
  2 10 would accept for the real property. The person's share of any
  2 11 compensatory property damages must be based on the person's
  2 12 share of the ownership interest in the real property.  For
  2 13 purposes of this section, ownership interest means holding
  2 14 legal or equitable title to real property in fee simple, as a
  2 15 life estate, or as a leasehold interest.
  2 16    b.  The person's compensatory damages due to the person's
  2 17 past, present, and future adverse health condition.  This
  2 18 determination shall be made utilizing only objective and
  2 19 documented medical evidence that the nuisance or interference
  2 20 with the comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2 21 property was the proximate cause of the person's adverse health
  2 22 condition.
  2 23    c.  The person's compensatory special damages proximately
  2 24 caused by the animal feeding operation, including without
  2 25 limitation, annoyance and the loss of comfortable use and
  2 26 enjoyment of real property.  However, the total damages
  2 27 awarded to a person who holds an ownership interest in the real
  2 28 property for which damages are awarded under this paragraph "c"
  2 29 shall not exceed one and one=half times the sum of any damages
  2 30 awarded to the person for the person's share of the total
  2 31 compensatory property damages awarded under paragraph "a" plus
  2 32 any compensatory damages awarded to the person under paragraph
  2 33 "b".
  2 34    4.  A person who alleges and fails to prove that an animal
  2 35 feeding operation is a public or private nuisance under this
  3  1 chapter or under principles of common law, or an interference
  3  2 with another person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the
  3  3 person's life or property under any other cause of action,
  3  4 shall be liable to the person against whom the cause of action
  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
  3  6 attorney fees incurred in the defense of the animal feeding
  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as

  3 19 animal feeding operation.
  3 20    b.  The failure to use existing prudent generally utilized

  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.

  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.

  1 11 persons involved in animal agriculture to adopt existing
  1 12 prudent and generally utilized management practices for their
  1 13 animal feeding operations, thereby enhancing the fundamental
  1 14 role of animal agriculture in this state by providing a
  1 15 reasonable level of protection to persons engaged in animal
  1 16 agricultural production from certain types of nuisance actions.
  1 17    c.  Declaration.  The general assembly has balanced all
  1 18 competing interests and declares its intent to preserve
  1 19 and enhance responsible animal agricultural production,
  1 20 specifically animal agricultural producers in this state
  1 21 who use existing prudent and generally utilized management
  1 22 practices reasonable for their animal feeding operations.
  1 23    2.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, an animal
  1 24 feeding operation, as defined in section 459.102, found to
  1 25 be a public or private nuisance under this chapter or under
  1 26 principles of common law, or found to interfere with another
  1 27 person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  1 28 property under any other cause of action, shall be conclusively
  1 29 presumed to be a permanent nuisance and not a temporary
  1 30 or continuing nuisance under principles of common law, and
  1 31 shall be subject to compensatory damages only as provided in
  1 32 subsection 3.
  1 33    3.  Compensatory damages awarded to a person bringing
  1 34 an action alleging that an animal feeding operation is a
  1 35 public or private nuisance, or an interference with another
  2  1 person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2  2 property under any other cause of action, shall not exceed the
  2  3 following:
  2  4    a.  The person's share of compensatory property damages due
  2  5 to any diminution in the fair market value of the person's real
  2  6 property proximately caused by the animal feeding operation.
  2  7 The fair market value of the real property is deemed to equal
  2  8 the price that a buyer who is willing but not compelled to
  2  9 buy and a seller who is willing but not compelled to sell
  2 10 would accept for the real property. The person's share of any
  2 11 compensatory property damages must be based on the person's
  2 12 share of the ownership interest in the real property.  For
  2 13 purposes of this section, ownership interest means holding
  2 14 legal or equitable title to real property in fee simple, as a
  2 15 life estate, or as a leasehold interest.
  2 16    b.  The person's compensatory damages due to the person's
  2 17 past, present, and future adverse health condition.  This
  2 18 determination shall be made utilizing only objective and
  2 19 documented medical evidence that the nuisance or interference
  2 20 with the comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2 21 property was the proximate cause of the person's adverse health
  2 22 condition.
  2 23    c.  The person's compensatory special damages proximately
  2 24 caused by the animal feeding operation, including without
  2 25 limitation, annoyance and the loss of comfortable use and
  2 26 enjoyment of real property.  However, the total damages
  2 27 awarded to a person who holds an ownership interest in the real
  2 28 property for which damages are awarded under this paragraph "c"
  2 29 shall not exceed one and one=half times the sum of any damages
  2 30 awarded to the person for the person's share of the total
  2 31 compensatory property damages awarded under paragraph "a" plus
  2 32 any compensatory damages awarded to the person under paragraph
  2 33 "b".
  2 34    4.  A person who alleges and fails to prove that an animal
  2 35 feeding operation is a public or private nuisance under this
  3  1 chapter or under principles of common law, or an interference
  3  2 with another person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the
  3  3 person's life or property under any other cause of action,
  3  4 shall be liable to the person against whom the cause of action
  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
  3  6 attorney fees incurred in the defense of the animal feeding
  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as
  3  9 court costs.
  3 10    5.  This section shall apply to an animal feeding operation
  3 11 in the same manner as section 657.11, subsection 4.
  3 12    6.  This section shall not apply if the person bringing

  1 25 be a public or private nuisance under this chapter or under
  1 26 principles of common law, or found to interfere with another
  1 27 person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  1 28 property under any other cause of action, shall be conclusively
  1 29 presumed to be a permanent nuisance and not a temporary
  1 30 or continuing nuisance under principles of common law, and
  1 31 shall be subject to compensatory damages only as provided in

  2 10 would accept for the real property. The person's share of any
  2 11 compensatory property damages must be based on the person's

  2 21 property was the proximate cause of the person's adverse health
  2 22 condition.
  2 23    c.  The person's compensatory special damages proximately
  2 24 caused by the animal feeding operation, including without
  2 25 limitation, annoyance and the loss of comfortable use and
  2 26 enjoyment of real property.  However, the total damages
  2 27 awarded to a person who holds an ownership interest in the real
  2 28 property for which damages are awarded under this paragraph "c"
  2 29 shall not exceed one and one=half times the sum of any damages
  2 30 awarded to the person for the person's share of the total
  2 31 compensatory property damages awarded under paragraph "a" plus
  2 32 any compensatory damages awarded to the person under paragraph
  2 33 "b".
  2 34    4.  A person who alleges and fails to prove that an animal
  2 35 feeding operation is a public or private nuisance under this

  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable

  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as
  3  9 court costs.
  3 10    5.  This section shall apply to an animal feeding operation
  3 11 in the same manner as section 657.11, subsection 4.
  3 12    6.  This section shall not apply if the person bringing

  3 18 regulation or a state statute or rule which applies to the
  3 19 animal feeding operation.
  3 20    b.  The failure to use existing prudent generally utilized
  3 21 management practices reasonable for the animal feeding
  3 22 operation.
  3 23    7.  This section does not apply to a person during  the
  3 24 time in which the person is classified as a habitual violator
  3 25 pursuant to section 459.604.

  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved

  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.
  5 24    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to

  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.
  5 24    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  1 16 agricultural production from certain types of nuisance actions.
  1 17    c.  Declaration.  The general assembly has balanced all
  1 18 competing interests and declares its intent to preserve
  1 19 and enhance responsible animal agricultural production,
  1 20 specifically animal agricultural producers in this state
  1 21 who use existing prudent and generally utilized management
  1 22 practices reasonable for their animal feeding operations.
  1 23    2.  Except as otherwise provided by this section, an animal
  1 24 feeding operation, as defined in section 459.102, found to
  1 25 be a public or private nuisance under this chapter or under
  1 26 principles of common law, or found to interfere with another
  1 27 person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  1 28 property under any other cause of action, shall be conclusively
  1 29 presumed to be a permanent nuisance and not a temporary
  1 30 or continuing nuisance under principles of common law, and
  1 31 shall be subject to compensatory damages only as provided in
  1 32 subsection 3.
  1 33    3.  Compensatory damages awarded to a person bringing
  1 34 an action alleging that an animal feeding operation is a
  1 35 public or private nuisance, or an interference with another
  2  1 person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2  2 property under any other cause of action, shall not exceed the
  2  3 following:
  2  4    a.  The person's share of compensatory property damages due
  2  5 to any diminution in the fair market value of the person's real
  2  6 property proximately caused by the animal feeding operation.
  2  7 The fair market value of the real property is deemed to equal
  2  8 the price that a buyer who is willing but not compelled to
  2  9 buy and a seller who is willing but not compelled to sell
  2 10 would accept for the real property. The person's share of any
  2 11 compensatory property damages must be based on the person's
  2 12 share of the ownership interest in the real property.  For
  2 13 purposes of this section, ownership interest means holding
  2 14 legal or equitable title to real property in fee simple, as a
  2 15 life estate, or as a leasehold interest.
  2 16    b.  The person's compensatory damages due to the person's
  2 17 past, present, and future adverse health condition.  This
  2 18 determination shall be made utilizing only objective and
  2 19 documented medical evidence that the nuisance or interference
  2 20 with the comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2 21 property was the proximate cause of the person's adverse health
  2 22 condition.
  2 23    c.  The person's compensatory special damages proximately
  2 24 caused by the animal feeding operation, including without
  2 25 limitation, annoyance and the loss of comfortable use and
  2 26 enjoyment of real property.  However, the total damages
  2 27 awarded to a person who holds an ownership interest in the real
  2 28 property for which damages are awarded under this paragraph "c"
  2 29 shall not exceed one and one=half times the sum of any damages
  2 30 awarded to the person for the person's share of the total
  2 31 compensatory property damages awarded under paragraph "a" plus
  2 32 any compensatory damages awarded to the person under paragraph
  2 33 "b".
  2 34    4.  A person who alleges and fails to prove that an animal
  2 35 feeding operation is a public or private nuisance under this
  3  1 chapter or under principles of common law, or an interference
  3  2 with another person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the
  3  3 person's life or property under any other cause of action,
  3  4 shall be liable to the person against whom the cause of action
  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
  3  6 attorney fees incurred in the defense of the animal feeding
  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as
  3  9 court costs.
  3 10    5.  This section shall apply to an animal feeding operation
  3 11 in the same manner as section 657.11, subsection 4.
  3 12    6.  This section shall not apply if the person bringing
  3 13 the action proves that the public or private nuisance or
  3 14 interference with another person's comfortable use and
  3 15 enjoyment of the person's life or property under any other
  3 16 cause of action is proximately caused by any of the following:
  3 17    a.  The failure to comply with a federal statute or
  3 18 regulation or a state statute or rule which applies to the
  3 19 animal feeding operation.
  3 20    b.  The failure to use existing prudent generally utilized
  3 21 management practices reasonable for the animal feeding
  3 22 operation.
  3 23    7.  This section does not apply to a person during  the
  3 24 time in which the person is classified as a habitual violator
  3 25 pursuant to section 459.604.
  3 26    8.  This section does not apply to a cause of action that
  3 27 accrued prior to the effective date of this Act.

  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.
  5 24    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  2  9 buy and a seller who is willing but not compelled to sell
  2 10 would accept for the real property. The person's share of any
  2 11 compensatory property damages must be based on the person's
  2 12 share of the ownership interest in the real property.  For
  2 13 purposes of this section, ownership interest means holding

  2 15 life estate, or as a leasehold interest.
  2 16    b.  The person's compensatory damages due to the person's

  2 18 determination shall be made utilizing only objective and
  2 19 documented medical evidence that the nuisance or interference
  2 20 with the comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2 21 property was the proximate cause of the person's adverse health
  2 22 condition.
  2 23    c.  The person's compensatory special damages proximately
  2 24 caused by the animal feeding operation, including without
  2 25 limitation, annoyance and the loss of comfortable use and
  2 26 enjoyment of real property.  However, the total damages
  2 27 awarded to a person who holds an ownership interest in the real
  2 28 property for which damages are awarded under this paragraph "c"
  2 29 shall not exceed one and one=half times the sum of any damages

  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.

  1 25 be a public or private nuisance under this chapter or under
  1 26 principles of common law, or found to interfere with another

  1 31 shall be subject to compensatory damages only as provided in

  1 33    3.  Compensatory damages awarded to a person bringing
  1 34 an action alleging that an animal feeding operation is a
  1 35 public or private nuisance, or an interference with another
  2  1 person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or

  2  5 to any diminution in the fair market value of the person's real

  2  7 The fair market value of the real property is deemed to equal
  2  8 the price that a buyer who is willing but not compelled to
  2  9 buy and a seller who is willing but not compelled to sell
  2 10 would accept for the real property. The person's share of any
  2 11 compensatory property damages must be based on the person's
  2 12 share of the ownership interest in the real property.  For
  2 13 purposes of this section, ownership interest means holding
  2 14 legal or equitable title to real property in fee simple, as a
  2 15 life estate, or as a leasehold interest.
  2 16    b.  The person's compensatory damages due to the person's
  2 17 past, present, and future adverse health condition.  This
  2 18 determination shall be made utilizing only objective and

  2 20 with the comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2 21 property was the proximate cause of the person's adverse health

  2 23    c.  The person's compensatory special damages proximately
  2 24 caused by the animal feeding operation, including without

  2 27 awarded to a person who holds an ownership interest in the real

  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable

  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as

  3 11 in the same manner as section 657.11, subsection 4.

  2  5 to any diminution in the fair market value of the person's real
  2  6 property proximately caused by the animal feeding operation.
  2  7 The fair market value of the real property is deemed to equal
  2  8 the price that a buyer who is willing but not compelled to
  2  9 buy and a seller who is willing but not compelled to sell
  2 10 would accept for the real property. The person's share of any
  2 11 compensatory property damages must be based on the person's
  2 12 share of the ownership interest in the real property.  For
  2 13 purposes of this section, ownership interest means holding
  2 14 legal or equitable title to real property in fee simple, as a
  2 15 life estate, or as a leasehold interest.
  2 16    b.  The person's compensatory damages due to the person's
  2 17 past, present, and future adverse health condition.  This
  2 18 determination shall be made utilizing only objective and
  2 19 documented medical evidence that the nuisance or interference
  2 20 with the comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2 21 property was the proximate cause of the person's adverse health
  2 22 condition.
  2 23    c.  The person's compensatory special damages proximately
  2 24 caused by the animal feeding operation, including without
  2 25 limitation, annoyance and the loss of comfortable use and
  2 26 enjoyment of real property.  However, the total damages
  2 27 awarded to a person who holds an ownership interest in the real
  2 28 property for which damages are awarded under this paragraph "c"
  2 29 shall not exceed one and one=half times the sum of any damages
  2 30 awarded to the person for the person's share of the total
  2 31 compensatory property damages awarded under paragraph "a" plus
  2 32 any compensatory damages awarded to the person under paragraph
  2 33 "b".
  2 34    4.  A person who alleges and fails to prove that an animal
  2 35 feeding operation is a public or private nuisance under this
  3  1 chapter or under principles of common law, or an interference
  3  2 with another person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the
  3  3 person's life or property under any other cause of action,
  3  4 shall be liable to the person against whom the cause of action
  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
  3  6 attorney fees incurred in the defense of the animal feeding
  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as
  3  9 court costs.
  3 10    5.  This section shall apply to an animal feeding operation
  3 11 in the same manner as section 657.11, subsection 4.
  3 12    6.  This section shall not apply if the person bringing
  3 13 the action proves that the public or private nuisance or
  3 14 interference with another person's comfortable use and
  3 15 enjoyment of the person's life or property under any other
  3 16 cause of action is proximately caused by any of the following:
  3 17    a.  The failure to comply with a federal statute or
  3 18 regulation or a state statute or rule which applies to the
  3 19 animal feeding operation.
  3 20    b.  The failure to use existing prudent generally utilized
  3 21 management practices reasonable for the animal feeding
  3 22 operation.
  3 23    7.  This section does not apply to a person during  the
  3 24 time in which the person is classified as a habitual violator
  3 25 pursuant to section 459.604.
  3 26    8.  This section does not apply to a cause of action that
  3 27 accrued prior to the effective date of this Act.
  3 28    Sec. 2.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act, being deemed of immediate
  3 29 importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.

  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable

  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as

  3 11 in the same manner as section 657.11, subsection 4.

  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be

  2  4    a.  The person's share of compensatory property damages due
  2  5 to any diminution in the fair market value of the person's real
  2  6 property proximately caused by the animal feeding operation.
  2  7 The fair market value of the real property is deemed to equal
  2  8 the price that a buyer who is willing but not compelled to
  2  9 buy and a seller who is willing but not compelled to sell
  2 10 would accept for the real property. The person's share of any
  2 11 compensatory property damages must be based on the person's
  2 12 share of the ownership interest in the real property.  For
  2 13 purposes of this section, ownership interest means holding
  2 14 legal or equitable title to real property in fee simple, as a
  2 15 life estate, or as a leasehold interest.
  2 16    b.  The person's compensatory damages due to the person's

  2 21 property was the proximate cause of the person's adverse health
  2 22 condition.
  2 23    c.  The person's compensatory special damages proximately
  2 24 caused by the animal feeding operation, including without
  2 25 limitation, annoyance and the loss of comfortable use and
  2 26 enjoyment of real property.  However, the total damages

  2 28 property for which damages are awarded under this paragraph "c"
  2 29 shall not exceed one and one=half times the sum of any damages
  2 30 awarded to the person for the person's share of the total
  2 31 compensatory property damages awarded under paragraph "a" plus
  2 32 any compensatory damages awarded to the person under paragraph
  2 33 "b".
  2 34    4.  A person who alleges and fails to prove that an animal
  2 35 feeding operation is a public or private nuisance under this
  3  1 chapter or under principles of common law, or an interference
  3  2 with another person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the
  3  3 person's life or property under any other cause of action,
  3  4 shall be liable to the person against whom the cause of action
  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
  3  6 attorney fees incurred in the defense of the animal feeding
  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as

  3 10    5.  This section shall apply to an animal feeding operation
  3 11 in the same manner as section 657.11, subsection 4.
  3 12    6.  This section shall not apply if the person bringing
  3 13 the action proves that the public or private nuisance or
  3 14 interference with another person's comfortable use and
  3 15 enjoyment of the person's life or property under any other

  3 17    a.  The failure to comply with a federal statute or
  3 18 regulation or a state statute or rule which applies to the
  3 19 animal feeding operation.
  3 20    b.  The failure to use existing prudent generally utilized
  3 21 management practices reasonable for the animal feeding
  3 22 operation.
  3 23    7.  This section does not apply to a person during  the
  3 24 time in which the person is classified as a habitual violator
  3 25 pursuant to section 459.604.

  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.

  2 33 "b".
  2 34    4.  A person who alleges and fails to prove that an animal

  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.

  1 33    3.  Compensatory damages awarded to a person bringing
  1 34 an action alleging that an animal feeding operation is a
  1 35 public or private nuisance, or an interference with another
  2  1 person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or

  2  8 the price that a buyer who is willing but not compelled to
  2  9 buy and a seller who is willing but not compelled to sell
  2 10 would accept for the real property. The person's share of any
  2 11 compensatory property damages must be based on the person's
  2 12 share of the ownership interest in the real property.  For

  2 24 caused by the animal feeding operation, including without

  2 27 awarded to a person who holds an ownership interest in the real
  2 28 property for which damages are awarded under this paragraph "c"
  2 29 shall not exceed one and one=half times the sum of any damages
  2 30 awarded to the person for the person's share of the total
  2 31 compensatory property damages awarded under paragraph "a" plus

  2 33 "b".
  2 34    4.  A person who alleges and fails to prove that an animal
  2 35 feeding operation is a public or private nuisance under this

  3  2 with another person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the
  3  3 person's life or property under any other cause of action,
  3  4 shall be liable to the person against whom the cause of action
  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
  3  6 attorney fees incurred in the defense of the animal feeding
  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as

  3 10    5.  This section shall apply to an animal feeding operation
  3 11 in the same manner as section 657.11, subsection 4.
  3 12    6.  This section shall not apply if the person bringing
  3 13 the action proves that the public or private nuisance or
  3 14 interference with another person's comfortable use and
  3 15 enjoyment of the person's life or property under any other
  3 16 cause of action is proximately caused by any of the following:

  3 19 animal feeding operation.
  3 20    b.  The failure to use existing prudent generally utilized

  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.
  5 24    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  1 33    3.  Compensatory damages awarded to a person bringing
  1 34 an action alleging that an animal feeding operation is a
  1 35 public or private nuisance, or an interference with another
  2  1 person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2  2 property under any other cause of action, shall not exceed the
  2  3 following:
  2  4    a.  The person's share of compensatory property damages due
  2  5 to any diminution in the fair market value of the person's real

  2  7 The fair market value of the real property is deemed to equal
  2  8 the price that a buyer who is willing but not compelled to
  2  9 buy and a seller who is willing but not compelled to sell
  2 10 would accept for the real property. The person's share of any
  2 11 compensatory property damages must be based on the person's
  2 12 share of the ownership interest in the real property.  For
  2 13 purposes of this section, ownership interest means holding
  2 14 legal or equitable title to real property in fee simple, as a
  2 15 life estate, or as a leasehold interest.
  2 16    b.  The person's compensatory damages due to the person's
  2 17 past, present, and future adverse health condition.  This
  2 18 determination shall be made utilizing only objective and

  2 20 with the comfortable use and enjoyment of the person's life or
  2 21 property was the proximate cause of the person's adverse health
  2 22 condition.
  2 23    c.  The person's compensatory special damages proximately
  2 24 caused by the animal feeding operation, including without
  2 25 limitation, annoyance and the loss of comfortable use and
  2 26 enjoyment of real property.  However, the total damages
  2 27 awarded to a person who holds an ownership interest in the real
  2 28 property for which damages are awarded under this paragraph "c"
  2 29 shall not exceed one and one=half times the sum of any damages
  2 30 awarded to the person for the person's share of the total
  2 31 compensatory property damages awarded under paragraph "a" plus
  2 32 any compensatory damages awarded to the person under paragraph
  2 33 "b".
  2 34    4.  A person who alleges and fails to prove that an animal
  2 35 feeding operation is a public or private nuisance under this
  3  1 chapter or under principles of common law, or an interference
  3  2 with another person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the
  3  3 person's life or property under any other cause of action,
  3  4 shall be liable to the person against whom the cause of action
  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
  3  6 attorney fees incurred in the defense of the animal feeding
  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as
  3  9 court costs.
  3 10    5.  This section shall apply to an animal feeding operation
  3 11 in the same manner as section 657.11, subsection 4.
  3 12    6.  This section shall not apply if the person bringing
  3 13 the action proves that the public or private nuisance or
  3 14 interference with another person's comfortable use and
  3 15 enjoyment of the person's life or property under any other
  3 16 cause of action is proximately caused by any of the following:
  3 17    a.  The failure to comply with a federal statute or
  3 18 regulation or a state statute or rule which applies to the
  3 19 animal feeding operation.
  3 20    b.  The failure to use existing prudent generally utilized
  3 21 management practices reasonable for the animal feeding
  3 22 operation.
  3 23    7.  This section does not apply to a person during  the
  3 24 time in which the person is classified as a habitual violator
  3 25 pursuant to section 459.604.
  3 26    8.  This section does not apply to a cause of action that
  3 27 accrued prior to the effective date of this Act.

  3 29 importance, takes effect upon enactment.

  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.
  5 24    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  3 19 animal feeding operation.
  3 20    b.  The failure to use existing prudent generally utilized

  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.

  2  5 to any diminution in the fair market value of the person's real
  2  6 property proximately caused by the animal feeding operation.
  2  7 The fair market value of the real property is deemed to equal
  2  8 the price that a buyer who is willing but not compelled to
  2  9 buy and a seller who is willing but not compelled to sell
  2 10 would accept for the real property. The person's share of any

  2 32 any compensatory damages awarded to the person under paragraph
  2 33 "b".

  3  2 with another person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the
  3  3 person's life or property under any other cause of action,

  3 18 regulation or a state statute or rule which applies to the
  3 19 animal feeding operation.
  3 20    b.  The failure to use existing prudent generally utilized

  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public

  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.

  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable

  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving

  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the

  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to

  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a

  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly

  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to

  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a

  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.
  5 24    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  2 11 compensatory property damages must be based on the person's
  2 12 share of the ownership interest in the real property.  For
  2 13 purposes of this section, ownership interest means holding

  2 15 life estate, or as a leasehold interest.
  2 16    b.  The person's compensatory damages due to the person's
  2 17 past, present, and future adverse health condition.  This

  2 21 property was the proximate cause of the person's adverse health
  2 22 condition.
  2 23    c.  The person's compensatory special damages proximately
  2 24 caused by the animal feeding operation, including without

  2 27 awarded to a person who holds an ownership interest in the real
  2 28 property for which damages are awarded under this paragraph "c"
  2 29 shall not exceed one and one=half times the sum of any damages
  2 30 awarded to the person for the person's share of the total
  2 31 compensatory property damages awarded under paragraph "a" plus
  2 32 any compensatory damages awarded to the person under paragraph
  2 33 "b".
  2 34    4.  A person who alleges and fails to prove that an animal
  2 35 feeding operation is a public or private nuisance under this
  3  1 chapter or under principles of common law, or an interference
  3  2 with another person's comfortable use and enjoyment of the
  3  3 person's life or property under any other cause of action,
  3  4 shall be liable to the person against whom the cause of action
  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
  3  6 attorney fees incurred in the defense of the animal feeding
  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as
  3  9 court costs.
  3 10    5.  This section shall apply to an animal feeding operation
  3 11 in the same manner as section 657.11, subsection 4.
  3 12    6.  This section shall not apply if the person bringing
  3 13 the action proves that the public or private nuisance or
  3 14 interference with another person's comfortable use and
  3 15 enjoyment of the person's life or property under any other
  3 16 cause of action is proximately caused by any of the following:
  3 17    a.  The failure to comply with a federal statute or
  3 18 regulation or a state statute or rule which applies to the
  3 19 animal feeding operation.
  3 20    b.  The failure to use existing prudent generally utilized
  3 21 management practices reasonable for the animal feeding
  3 22 operation.
  3 23    7.  This section does not apply to a person during  the
  3 24 time in which the person is classified as a habitual violator
  3 25 pursuant to section 459.604.
  3 26    8.  This section does not apply to a cause of action that
  3 27 accrued prior to the effective date of this Act.

  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and

  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially

  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an

  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.

  2 27 awarded to a person who holds an ownership interest in the real
  2 28 property for which damages are awarded under this paragraph "c"
  2 29 shall not exceed one and one=half times the sum of any damages

  3  5 was brought for all costs and expenses, including reasonable
  3  6 attorney fees incurred in the defense of the animal feeding
  3  7 operation as determined by the court.  The costs and expenses
  3  8 attributable to reasonable attorney fees shall be taxed as
  3  9 court costs.
  3 10    5.  This section shall apply to an animal feeding operation
  3 11 in the same manner as section 657.11, subsection 4.
  3 12    6.  This section shall not apply if the person bringing
  3 13 the action proves that the public or private nuisance or
  3 14 interference with another person's comfortable use and
  3 15 enjoyment of the person's life or property under any other
  3 16 cause of action is proximately caused by any of the following:

  3 19 animal feeding operation.
  3 20    b.  The failure to use existing prudent generally utilized

  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public

  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a

  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,

  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights

  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's

  3 30                           EXPLANATION
  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.

  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to

  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a

  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's
  5 23 effective date.

  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving

  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be

  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to
  5 18 use existing prudent generally utilized management practices
  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a
  5 21 habitual violator who has committed three or more environmental
  5 22 violations, and (4) the cause of action arose before the bill's

  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an

  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.

  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be

  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation
  5 16 failed to comply with an applicable  federal or state statute
  5 17 or regulation, (2) the animal feeding operation failed to

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    GENERAL.  This bill allows for an affirmative defense to be
  3 34 raised in certain cause of actions in which an animal feeding
  3 35 operation is alleged to be a public or private nuisance or
  4  1 to otherwise interfere with a person's comfortable use and
  4  2 enjoyment of life or property.  The cause of action may be
  4  3 brought under Code chapter 657, which addresses private and
  4  4 public nuisances, or under common law principles.
  4  5    FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.  The bill includes general assembly
  4  6 findings that the public's interests are advanced by preserving
  4  7 and encouraging responsible animal agricultural production,
  4  8 and states the bill's purpose is to encourage persons involved
  4  9 in animal agriculture to adopt existing prudent and generally
  4 10 utilized management practices for their animal feeding
  4 11 operations.
  4 12    PRIVATE AND PUBLIC NUISANCE.  An affirmative defense may be
  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially
  4 18 interferes with the public's use and enjoyment of legal rights
  4 19 common to the public.
  4 20    PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY OR CONTINUING NUISANCES.  If the
  4 21 affirmative defense prevails,  the animal feeding operation is
  4 22 conclusively deemed to be a permanent rather than a temporary
  4 23 or continuing nuisance.  A temporary or continuing nuisance
  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
  5  2 damages for intangible injuries such as annoyance or the loss
  5  3 of comfortable use and enjoyment of real property.  In the case
  5  4 of special damages, the total awarded cannot exceed one and
  5  5 one=half times the combined amounts for property damages and
  5  6 damages resulting from an adverse health condition.
  5  7    COSTS.  A party who alleges and fails to prove that an
  5  8 animal feeding operation is a public or private nuisance is
  5  9 liable to pay the other party all costs and expenses, including
  5 10 reasonable attorney fees incurred in the defense.
  5 11    DATE OF OPERATION.  The affirmative defense may be raised
  5 12 regardless of the established date of operation or expansion of
  5 13 the animal feeding operation.
  5 14    EXCLUSIONS.  The affirmative defense is not available
  5 15 in certain circumstances:  (1) an animal feeding operation

  5 19 reasonable for the animal feeding operation, (3)  the animal
  5 20 feeding operation is controlled by a person classified as a

  4 13 raised if the allegation involves either a private or public
  4 14 nuisance.  A private nuisance occurs when a person (defendant)
  4 15 uses the person's land in a manner that unreasonably or
  4 16 substantially interferes with the enjoyment of another person
  4 17 (plaintiff).  A public nuisance unreasonably and substantially

  4 24 refers to an injury that occurs intermittently and which may
  4 25 be the basis for a number of actions for damages claimed by
  4 26 the same party.  A permanent nuisance is expected to continue
  4 27 indefinitely and the award is for an amount equaling the total
  4 28 resulting damages, including future damages that may result
  4 29 from the nuisance as it then exists.
  4 30    LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.  The affirmative defense limits
  4 31 compensatory damages as opposed to punitive damages proximately
  4 32 caused by the animal feeding operation and specifies three
  4 33 categories of awards, including (1)  damages for any diminution
  4 34 in the fair market value of a person's real property; (2)
  4 35 damages due to a person's past, present, and future adverse
  5  1 health condition based on medical evidence; and (3) special
