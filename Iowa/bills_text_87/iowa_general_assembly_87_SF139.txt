  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    This bill establishes a criminal penalty for a violent
  3 34 repeat offender and reduces earned time for offenders
  3 35 required to participate in batterers' education under certain
  4  1 circumstances, provides for risk assessments, and relates to
  4  2 electronic tracking and monitoring.
  4  3    If a presentence investigation is required prior
  4  4 to sentencing, the bill requires that the presentence
  4  5 investigation include a risk assessment of the offender, if the
  4  6 offender was convicted of domestic abuse assault in violation
  4  7 of Code section 708.2A, harassment in violation of Code section
  4  8 708.7, or stalking in violation of Code section 708.11.
  4  9    The bill specifies that an offender placed on probation,

  4 27 are eligible for a reduction of sentence equal to one and
  4 28 two=tenths days for each day the inmate demonstrates good

  4 31 rate of reduction of sentence for an offender who is serving
  4 32 a 70 percent sentence under Code section 902.12. However, an
  4 33 offender serving a violent repeat offender sentence is not
  4 34 required to serve seven=tenths of the maximum term of the
  4 35 sentence prior to being eligible for parole or work release as
  5  1 an offender serving a 70 percent sentence is required to serve.
  5  2    In order to preserve the service of a 70 percent sentence by
  5  3 an offender, a person shall not be a violent repeat offender
  5  4 if the most recent conviction that would otherwise make the
  5  5 offender a violent repeat offender is a conviction for murder
  5  6 in the second degree in violation of Code section 707.3,
  5  7 attempted murder in violation of Code section 707.11, sexual

  5 14 degree, kidnapping in the second degree, robbery in the first
  5 15 degree, or robbery in the second degree shall be counted as

  5 17 violent repeat offender.
  5 18    The bill provides that an inmate at a correctional
  5 19 institution who is required to participate in a batterers'
