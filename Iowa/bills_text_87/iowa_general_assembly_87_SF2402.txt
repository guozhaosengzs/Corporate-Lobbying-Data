  1  3      1  3      1  4 the total amount of governmental pension or retirement pay
  1  5 received by a taxpayer or the qualified beneficiary of a
  1  6 taxpayer from a public retirement system to the extent the
  1  7 governmental pension or retirement pay relates to a period
  1  8 of public employment that was not covered under Tit. II of
  1  9 the federal Social Security Act and for which social security
  1 10 retirement contributions with respect to wages under the
  1 11 federal Insurance Contributions Act were not made, not to
  1 12 exceed an amount which the taxpayer would have received during
  1 13 the tax year as federal social security retirement benefits for
  1 14 that same period of public employment had the employment been
  1 15 covered under Tit. II of the federal Social Security Act and
  1 16 had social security retirement contributions with respect to
  1 17 wages been made under the federal Insurance Contributions Act.
  1 18    b.  The exclusion of amounts of governmental pension or

  1 21    c.  The director of revenue shall adopt rules pursuant to
  1 22 chapter 17A to administer this subsection, including but not
  1 23 limited to rules for determining the amount of social security
  1 24 benefits a taxpayer or the qualified beneficiary would have
  1 25 received during a tax year.
  1 26    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to tax years
  1 27 beginning on or after January 1, 2019.
  1 28                           EXPLANATION
  1 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 31    BACKGROUND.  Certain public employers do not participate in
  1 32 the federal old=age, survivors, and disability benefits program
  1 33 under Tit. II of the federal Social Security Act (social
  1 34 security retirement).  Thus, employees of that public employer
  1 35 are not subject to the mandatory wage contributions related
  2  1 to social security retirement under the federal Insurance
  2  2 Contributions Act (FICA social security tax) and do not receive
  2  3 social security retirement benefits with respect to that period
  2  4 of public employment.  Iowa excludes social security retirement
  2  5 benefits from taxation under the individual income tax.
  2  6    BILL CHANGES.  This bill provides an exclusion from the
  2  7 individual income tax for governmental pension or retirement
  2  8 pay received by a taxpayer or the qualified beneficiary of
  2  9 a taxpayer from a public retirement system to the extent it
  2 10 relates to a period of public employment that was not covered
  2 11 by social security retirement and for which FICA social
  2 12 security tax was not collected and paid.  The exclusion cannot
  2 13 exceed an amount equal to the social security retirement
  2 14 benefits the taxpayer would have received during the tax year
  2 15 with respect to that period of public employment had the
  2 16 employment been covered by social security retirement and had
  2 17 FICA social security tax been collected and paid.
  2 18    The bill provides that this exclusion is in addition to the
  2 19 general pension exclusion in Code section 422.7(31).
  2 20    By operation of law, this excluded retirement income will
  2 21 be included in the calculation of net income for purposes of
  2 22 determining the income tax return filing threshold, and for
  2 23 purposes of the alternate tax calculation in Code section
  2 24 422.5, in the same manner as social security retirement
  2 25 benefits are.
  2 26    The bill requires the director of the department of revenue
  2 27 to adopt rules to administer the exemption, including rules for
  2 28 determining the amount of social security benefits a taxpayer
  2 29 or the qualified beneficiary would have received during a tax
  2 30 year.
  2 31    The bill applies to tax years beginning on or after January
  2 32 1, 2019.

  1 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

  1 32 the federal old=age, survivors, and disability benefits program
  1 33 under Tit. II of the federal Social Security Act (social
  1 34 security retirement).  Thus, employees of that public employer
  1 35 are not subject to the mandatory wage contributions related
  2  1 to social security retirement under the federal Insurance
  2  2 Contributions Act (FICA social security tax) and do not receive
  2  3 social security retirement benefits with respect to that period
  2  4 of public employment.  Iowa excludes social security retirement
  2  5 benefits from taxation under the individual income tax.
  2  6    BILL CHANGES.  This bill provides an exclusion from the

  2 10 relates to a period of public employment that was not covered
  2 11 by social security retirement and for which FICA social

  2 17 FICA social security tax been collected and paid.
  2 18    The bill provides that this exclusion is in addition to the
  2 19 general pension exclusion in Code section 422.7(31).
  2 20    By operation of law, this excluded retirement income will
  2 21 be included in the calculation of net income for purposes of

  1 28                           EXPLANATION
  1 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 31    BACKGROUND.  Certain public employers do not participate in
  1 32 the federal old=age, survivors, and disability benefits program
  1 33 under Tit. II of the federal Social Security Act (social
  1 34 security retirement).  Thus, employees of that public employer
  1 35 are not subject to the mandatory wage contributions related
  2  1 to social security retirement under the federal Insurance
  2  2 Contributions Act (FICA social security tax) and do not receive
  2  3 social security retirement benefits with respect to that period
  2  4 of public employment.  Iowa excludes social security retirement
  2  5 benefits from taxation under the individual income tax.
  2  6    BILL CHANGES.  This bill provides an exclusion from the
  2  7 individual income tax for governmental pension or retirement
  2  8 pay received by a taxpayer or the qualified beneficiary of
  2  9 a taxpayer from a public retirement system to the extent it
  2 10 relates to a period of public employment that was not covered
  2 11 by social security retirement and for which FICA social
  2 12 security tax was not collected and paid.  The exclusion cannot
  2 13 exceed an amount equal to the social security retirement
  2 14 benefits the taxpayer would have received during the tax year
  2 15 with respect to that period of public employment had the
  2 16 employment been covered by social security retirement and had
  2 17 FICA social security tax been collected and paid.
  2 18    The bill provides that this exclusion is in addition to the
  2 19 general pension exclusion in Code section 422.7(31).
  2 20    By operation of law, this excluded retirement income will
  2 21 be included in the calculation of net income for purposes of
  2 22 determining the income tax return filing threshold, and for
  2 23 purposes of the alternate tax calculation in Code section
  2 24 422.5, in the same manner as social security retirement
  2 25 benefits are.
  2 26    The bill requires the director of the department of revenue
  2 27 to adopt rules to administer the exemption, including rules for
  2 28 determining the amount of social security benefits a taxpayer
  2 29 or the qualified beneficiary would have received during a tax
  2 30 year.

  2 32 1, 2019.
