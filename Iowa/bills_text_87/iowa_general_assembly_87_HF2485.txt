 15 25 installment loan at a rate not to exceed eleven dollars and

 15 30 full within seven days, equal to five percent of the amount of

 16  1 a check, draft, negotiable order of withdrawal, or similar
 16  2 instrument that is not paid or is not honored by a depository
 16  3 institution, equal to the actual charges assessed by the
 16  4 depository institution.
 16  5    2.  A licensee shall not directly or indirectly charge,

 16  9                           EXPLANATION
 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 16 13 of persons who wish to provide small dollar installment loans
 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

       gh/rn
 15 22 536B.21, a licensee may collect any of the following fees or
 15 23 charges:

 15 25 installment loan at a rate not to exceed eleven dollars and
 15 26 twenty=five cents per one hundred dollars loaned. Such fee

 15 31 the installment.
 15 32    c.  Court costs and reasonable attorney fees if the small
 15 33 dollar installment loan is referred for collection to an
 15 34 attorney other than an employee of the licensee.
 15 35    d.  A dishonored check service fee if a licensee receives
 16  1 a check, draft, negotiable order of withdrawal, or similar
 16  2 instrument that is not paid or is not honored by a depository
 16  3 institution, equal to the actual charges assessed by the
 16  4 depository institution.
 16  5    2.  A licensee shall not directly or indirectly charge,

 16  7 a small dollar installment loan except as provided in this

 16  9                           EXPLANATION
 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure

 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 15 33 dollar installment loan is referred for collection to an

 15 35    d.  A dishonored check service fee if a licensee receives
 16  1 a check, draft, negotiable order of withdrawal, or similar

 16  4 depository institution.
 16  5    2.  A licensee shall not directly or indirectly charge,

 16  9                           EXPLANATION
 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 16 13 of persons who wish to provide small dollar installment loans
 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.
       LSB 2667HV (4) 87
       gh/rn
 15 25 installment loan at a rate not to exceed eleven dollars and
 15 26 twenty=five cents per one hundred dollars loaned. Such fee
 15 27 shall be refundable to the consumer on a pro rata basis upon
 15 28 prepayment in full prior to the maturity date of the loan.
 15 29    b.  A delinquency charge if an installment is not paid in
 15 30 full within seven days, equal to five percent of the amount of
 15 31 the installment.
 15 32    c.  Court costs and reasonable attorney fees if the small
 15 33 dollar installment loan is referred for collection to an
 15 34 attorney other than an employee of the licensee.
 15 35    d.  A dishonored check service fee if a licensee receives
 16  1 a check, draft, negotiable order of withdrawal, or similar
 16  2 instrument that is not paid or is not honored by a depository
 16  3 institution, equal to the actual charges assessed by the
 16  4 depository institution.
 16  5    2.  A licensee shall not directly or indirectly charge,
 16  6 contract for, or receive any other amount in connection with
 16  7 a small dollar installment loan except as provided in this
 16  8 chapter.

 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal

 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the

 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,

 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.

 16  9                           EXPLANATION
 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 16 13 of persons who wish to provide small dollar installment loans
 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or

 21 32 loan transactions.

 15 33 dollar installment loan is referred for collection to an
 15 34 attorney other than an employee of the licensee.

 16  1 a check, draft, negotiable order of withdrawal, or similar
 16  2 instrument that is not paid or is not honored by a depository
 16  3 institution, equal to the actual charges assessed by the
 16  4 depository institution.

 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as

 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a

 16  9                           EXPLANATION
 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 16 13 of persons who wish to provide small dollar installment loans
 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of

 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a

 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16  4 depository institution.

 16  7 a small dollar installment loan except as provided in this
 16  8 chapter.
 16  9                           EXPLANATION
 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 16 13 of persons who wish to provide small dollar installment loans
 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth

 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee

 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16  9                           EXPLANATION
 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 16 13 of persons who wish to provide small dollar installment loans
 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth

 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16  9                           EXPLANATION
 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 16 13 of persons who wish to provide small dollar installment loans
 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar

 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee

 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 16 13 of persons who wish to provide small dollar installment loans
 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,

 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16  9                           EXPLANATION
 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 16 13 of persons who wish to provide small dollar installment loans
 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,

 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16  9                           EXPLANATION
 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 16 13 of persons who wish to provide small dollar installment loans
 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,

 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as

 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a

 16  9                           EXPLANATION
 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 16 13 of persons who wish to provide small dollar installment loans
 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 12    This bill creates new Code chapter 536B to require licensure
 16 13 of persons who wish to provide small dollar installment loans
 16 14 to residents of the state.
 16 15    The bill defines "small dollar installment loan" to mean
 16 16 a loan that is incurred for a personal, family, or household
 16 17 purpose, is not less than $500 and not more than $1,000, is
 16 18 unsecured, is held for a specified period, is payable in
 16 19 biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly payment installments, is
 16 20 subject to prepayment in whole or in part at any time without
 16 21 penalty, and is for a term length of a minimum of six months and
 16 22 a maximum of 12 months.
 16 23    The bill exempts the following persons from the requirements
 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;

 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly

 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing

 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial

 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails

 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating

 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,

 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the

 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license

 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A

 16 24 of the bill: a person who does business under any law relating
 16 25 to banks, savings banks, trusts, savings and loan associations,
 16 26 profit sharing and pension trusts, credit unions, insurance
 16 27 companies, or receiverships, a person who is not regularly
 16 28 engaged in the business of making small dollar installment
 16 29 loans, as defined in the bill, a person who is licensed
 16 30 pursuant to another Iowa Code chapter to the extent that
 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A

 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,

 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the

 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is

 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the

 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining

 20 28 of the business.

 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under

 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an

 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal

 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.

 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the

 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of

 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent

 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;

 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil

 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.

 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to

 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has

 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or

 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The

 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under

 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a

 16 31 the person's activities are governed by that Code chapter,
 16 32 or a consumer loan with a finance charge as permitted under
 16 33 specified law.
 16 34    The bill prohibits a person from operating a small dollar
 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A

 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or

 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is

 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 16 35 installment loan business in the state unless the person is
 17  1 physically located in the state and is licensed pursuant to
 17  2 the bill. The bill requires an application for a license
 17  3 to include an application fee of $100 and a surety bond, as
 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating
 17 13 the business. The superintendent shall approve or deny an
 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of

 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the

 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of

 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is

 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability

 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of

 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;

 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal

 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall

 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise

 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,

 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 17  4 described in the bill. The superintendent of banking shall
 17  5 issue a license pursuant to the bill if the superintendent
 17  6 finds all of the following: the experience, character, and
 17  7 general fitness of the applicant is such as to warrant a
 17  8 finding that the applicant will conduct the small dollar
 17  9 installment loan business honestly, fairly, and efficiently;
 17 10 the applicant has not been convicted of a felony; the
 17 11 applicant is financially responsible; and the applicant has
 17 12 unencumbered assets of at least $25,000 available for operating

 17 14 application for a license by written order within 90 days of
 17 15 filing.
 17 16    The bill requires a license issued pursuant to the bill to be
 17 17 conspicuously posted at the licensee's place of business. A
 17 18 license is valid until the next succeeding January 1, unless
 17 19 earlier suspended or revoked. The bill provides that a license
 17 20 shall be renewed annually by filing a renewal application with
 17 21 the superintendent on or before December 1. The superintendent
 17 22 may assess a late fee of $10 per day for a late renewal
 17 23 application. The bill allows the superintendent to license
 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.
 17 35    The bill requires a licensee to notify the superintendent
 18  1 in writing within 30 days upon any of the following: filing
 18  2 for bankruptcy or reorganization; reorganization of the
 18  3 business; commencement of license revocation or any other civil
 18  4 or criminal proceedings by any other state or jurisdiction;
 18  5 the filing of a criminal indictment or complaint against the
 18  6 licensee or any other specified persons; or a felony conviction
 18  7 against the licensee or any other specified persons.
 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The
 18 12 person requesting such approval shall pay a $100 fee to
 18 13 the superintendent, as well as any costs incurred by the
 18 14 superintendent in investigating a change in control request.
 18 15 A license issued pursuant to the bill is not transferable or
 18 16 assignable.
 18 17    The bill provides that a licensee may operate a small dollar
 18 18 installment loan business only at its designated principal
 18 19 place of business, where the licensee shall maintain its books,
 18 20 accounts, and records. A licensee may change the location of
 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is
 18 24 located, with the prior written approval of the superintendent.
 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall
 18 27 pay a $25 fee to the superintendent for a request to change
 18 28 the location of a principal place of business, to establish a
 18 29 branch office, or to provide notice of a name change.
 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties

 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,

 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The

 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other

 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or

 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.

 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of

 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is

 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation

 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining

 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
 21 31 fees in connection with conducting small dollar installment
 21 32 loan transactions.

 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must

 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee

 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.

 18  8    The bill requires prior written approval of the
 18  9 superintendent for the continued operation of a small dollar
 18 10 installment loan business whenever a change in control
 18 11 of a licensee is proposed, as described in the bill. The

 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The

 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.
 19 16 The superintendent may disclose information to other state
 19 17 or federal regulatory authorities and may receive documents,
 19 18 materials, or other information through a nationwide licensing
 19 19 system and from other regulatory agencies, as provided in the
 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the
 19 23 superintendent finds any of the following: the licensee or any
 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a

 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The

 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it

 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining

 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not

 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or

 17 24 applicants through a nationwide licensing system and to use
 17 25 such system as a channeling agent with the federal government.
 17 26    The bill provides that a licensee may surrender a license by
 17 27 delivering written notice to the superintendent. The surrender
 17 28 shall not affect the licensee's criminal or civil liability
 17 29 for acts committed prior to the surrender, the liability of
 17 30 the surety bond, or payment of the annual license fee. The
 17 31 superintendent may establish procedures for the disposition of
 17 32 the surrendered licensee's books, accounts, and records and may
 17 33 require any action necessary for the protection of outstanding
 17 34 makers of checks.

 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a

 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.

 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a

 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is

 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the

 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10

 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee

 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as

 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a

 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.

 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the

 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a

 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.

 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a

 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A

 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.

 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the

 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a

 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a

 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination

 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the

 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.

 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth
 21  3 in Lending Act. A licensee cannot provide a small dollar
 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at

 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or

 18 21 its principal place of business with the prior written approval
 18 22 of the superintendent. A licensee may establish branch offices
 18 23 in the same county in which the principal place of business is

 18 25 A licensee shall notify the superintendent 30 days in advance
 18 26 of a change in the name of the licensee. A licensee shall

 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend

 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The
 19  8 superintendent may also examine or investigate complaints or
 19  9 reports concerning alleged violations of the bill, and may
 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.

 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a

 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee

 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as

 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a

 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall
 19 14 subject the licensee to a late fee of up to 5 percent of the
 19 15 amount of the fee for each day the payment is delinquent.

 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not
 20 31 impair or affect the validity of a preexisting small dollar
 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.
 20 34    The bill prohibits a licensee from advertising in any false
 20 35 or misleading manner with regards to the rates or terms of
 21  1 a small dollar installment loan and requires a licensee to
 21  2 comply with the advertising requirements in the federal Truth

 21  4 installment loan to a military member or dependent, as defined
 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee
 21 13 must display a disclosure sign, as described in the bill, at
 21 14 each desk in the licensed office and each licensed branch
 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or

 21 32 loan transactions.

 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,

 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation

 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the

 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation

 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the

 18 30    The bill permits a licensee to operate a small dollar
 18 31 installment loan business at a location where any other
 18 32 business is operated with the written approval of the
 18 33 superintendent, so long as the licensee's books, accounts, and
 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend

 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the

 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a

 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.

 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,

 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a

 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or

 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,
 20 30 surrender, cancellation, or alteration of a license will not

 20 32 installment loan or the ability of a lender to service a
 20 33 preexisting loan outside of this state.

 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10
 21 10 U.S.C. {987 is void and its terms and conditions unenforceable.
 21 11    The bill requires a licensee to comply with the disclosure
 21 12 requirements in the federal Truth in Lending Act. A licensee

 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A

 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license

 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation

 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a

 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a

 18 34 records are kept separate and apart from the other business,
 18 35 and the other business is not of a type which would tend
 19  1 to enable the concealment of acts engaged in to evade the
 19  2 requirements of the bill.
 19  3    The bill requires the superintendent to examine the books,
 19  4 accounts, and records of each licensee at least once a year
 19  5 and as needed to secure information required by the bill and
 19  6 to determine whether any violations of the bill have occurred.
 19  7 The licensee shall pay the cost of the examination. The

 19 10 order the actual cost of the examination or investigation as
 19 11 specified in the bill be paid by the person subject to such
 19 12 examination or investigation. Failure to pay the examination
 19 13 or investigation fee within 30 days of receipt of demand shall

 19 20 bill.
 19 21    The bill permits the superintendent to take disciplinary
 19 22 action against a licensee, after notice and hearing, if the

 19 24 other specified person has violated any provision of the bill,
 19 25 any rule adopted by the superintendent, or any other applicable
 19 26 state or federal law; the licensee has failed to pay a license
 19 27 fee or to maintain in effect the required surety bond; a fact
 19 28 or condition existing which would have resulted in the initial
 19 29 denial of issuance of a license; the licensee has abandoned its
 19 30 place of business for 60 days or more; or the licensee fails
 19 31 to pay an administrative penalty or the cost of investigation
 19 32 as ordered. The superintendent may impose one or more of the
 19 33 following disciplinary actions against a licensee: revoke a
 19 34 license; suspend a license; impose a period of probation under
 19 35 specified conditions; impose civil or administrative penalties
 20  1 in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation; issue a
 20  2 citation and warning; or order the licensee to pay restitution.
 20  3 The superintendent may also order an emergency suspension of
 20  4 a license as provided in the bill. The bill provides that a
 20  5 license shall not be revoked or suspended except after notice
 20  6 and a hearing.
 20  7    The bill permits the superintendent to issue a cease and
 20  8 desist order on any person the superintendent believes is
 20  9 engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of the bill
 20 10 or any rule or order issued by the superintendent. The
 20 11 bill provides procedures for notice and hearing for the
 20 12 issuance of a cease and desist order, as provided in the bill.
 20 13 After notice and hearing, if so requested or ordered, the
 20 14 superintendent shall affirm, vacate, or modify the order. The
 20 15 superintendent may vacate or modify an order if conditions
 20 16 which caused its entry have changed or if it is otherwise
 20 17 in the public interest to do so. The bill also permits the
 20 18 attorney general to initiate action in district court if it
 20 19 appears a person has engaged in or will engage in a violation
 20 20 of the bill, as provided in the bill.
 20 21    The bill provides that a person who operates a small dollar
 20 22 installment loan business in the state without first obtaining
 20 23 a license or while such license is suspended or revoked is
 20 24 guilty of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is
 20 25 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 20 26 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875. In addition, the
 20 27 superintendent may commence an action to enjoin the operation
 20 28 of the business.
 20 29    The bill provides that the revocation, suspension,

 21  5 in 10 U.S.C. {987(i), with an annual percentage rate greater
 21  6 than that provided in 10 U.S.C. {987(b). Before a licensee
 21  7 may provide a small dollar installment loan, the consumer must
 21  8 sign a statement attesting to whether or not the consumer is a
 21  9 military member or dependent. A loan made in violation of 10

 21 15 office and on the licensee's internet site if the licensee
 21 16 provides electronic small dollar installment loans. A licensee
 21 17 who fails to do so is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
 21 18 $300 for each violation.
 21 19    The bill allows a licensee to charge a finance charge, as
 21 20 defined in the bill, on a small dollar installment loan at
 21 21 a rate not to exceed 20 percent of the first $500 loaned,
 21 22 plus 7.5 percent of any amount in excess of $500 loaned. The
 21 23 finance charge shall be deemed fully earned as of the date of
 21 24 the loan transaction and shall not be refundable or prorated
 21 25 in the event of prepayment. A licensee is not permitted to
 21 26 compound a finance charge. In addition to a finance charge, a
 21 27 licensee may collect a monthly maintenance fee, a delinquency
 21 28 charge, court costs and reasonable attorney fees, and a
 21 29 dishonored check service fee, as described in the bill. A
 21 30 licensee is prohibited from collecting any other charges or
