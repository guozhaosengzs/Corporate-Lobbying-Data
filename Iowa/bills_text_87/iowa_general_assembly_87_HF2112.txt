  1 18    This bill provides that an insurer that has issued a fire
  1 19 and casualty insurance policy for the payment of damages to
  1 20 real property located in a city must reserve an amount equal to
  1 21 $20,000 or 20 percent of the payment for damages, whichever is
  1 22 greater, as a demolition cost reserve. Currently, the required
  1 23 amount is $10,000 or 10 percent of the payment, whichever is
  1 24 greater.
  1 25    A city can claim proceeds from the reserve if the city incurs
  1 26 costs to demolish a building where the damage to the property
  1 27 renders it uninhabitable or unfit for its purpose, without
  1 28 repair, and proof of loss indicates that damage to the insured
  1 29 structure or building exceeds 75 percent of the face value of
  1 30 the policy covering the building or structure.
  1 31    The bill also includes a request that the legislative
  1 32 council establish an interim study committee for the purpose of
  1 33 reviewing the demolition reserve statute to consider whether
  1 34 the statute adequately meets the needs of cities of various
  1 35 sizes and geographic locations within the state.
