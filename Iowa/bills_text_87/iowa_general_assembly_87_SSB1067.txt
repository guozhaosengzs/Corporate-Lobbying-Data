14


under

the

commercial
15


code

20


BACKGROUND.
Article
9
of
the
UCC
provides
for
the
rights
and
21


duties
of
a
creditor
and
debtor
regarding
the
debtor’s
personal
22


property
used
to
collateralize
a
debt,
including
prioritizing
23


the
status
of
different
creditors
exercising
rights
to
the
same
24


collateral.
In
order
to
obtain
such
status,
a
creditor
must
25


file
a
financing
statement
(UCC-1)
with
the
secretary
of
state
26


and
thereby
perfect
the
creditor’s
security
interest.
The
UCC
27


also
recognizes
a
number
of
agricultural
liens
existing
in
28


Code
chapters
outside
the
article,
including
the
custom
cattle
29


feedlot
lien
(Code
chapter
579A),
subject
to
the
same
filing
30


requirements.
For
each
type
of
agricultural
lien,
the
creditor
31


has
a
unique
time
period
within
which
to
file
a
financing
32


statement.
Once
the
financing
statement
is
timely
filed
and
33


the
lien
is
thereby
perfected,
the
creditor’s
priority
is
based
34


on
the
type
of
agricultural
lien
attaching
to
the
collateral
