A
Resolution
urging
the
nullification
of
rules
adopted
1


by
the
United
States
Environmental
Protection
2


Agency
relating
to
national
emissions
standards
for
3


hazardous
air
pollutants
for
reciprocating
internal
4


combustion
engines.
5


WHEREAS,
the
United
States
Environmental
6


Protection
Agency
in
March
2010
finalized
national
7


emissions
standards
for
hazardous
air
pollutants
for
8


reciprocating
internal
combustion
engines
which
took
9


effect
in
May
2013;
and
10


WHEREAS,
the
rules
would
have
a
devastating
impact
11


on
Iowa’s
municipal
utilities
due
to
the
fact
that
the
12


municipal
utilities
collectively
operate
287
diesel
13


electric
generators
with
a
combined
nameplate
capacity
14


of
548
megawatts;
and
15


WHEREAS,
these
rules
impact
67
utilities
that
serve
16


a
total
of
106,000
customers
with
an
average
of
1,560
17


customer
meters
per
utility;
and
18


WHEREAS,
Iowa’s
municipal
electric
utilities
19


operate
diesel
generators
both
to
be
able
to
keep
the
20


lights
on
when
transmissions
lines
are
downed
by
ice,

wind,
floods,
or
other
natural
disasters
or
man-made
1


emergencies,
and
to
meet
the
obligation
to
own
or
buy
2


reserve
capacity;
and
3


WHEREAS,
the
rules
allow
a
municipal
electric
4


utility
to
run
diesel
generators
in
an
emergency,
but
5


effectively
take
away
the
ability
of
a
small
community
6


to
afford
them
by
prohibiting
the
receipt
of
payment
or
7


credit
for
reserve
capacity;
and
8


WHEREAS,
the
diesel
generators
run
only
a
few
hours
9


a
year,
with
averages
ranging
from
14
to
46
hours
10


depending
on
power
supply
arrangements;
and
11


WHEREAS,
the
application
of
the
rules
requires
that
12


each
of
these
engines
either
be
retrofit,
replaced,
13


or
removed,
resulting
in
huge
cost
increases
to
the
14


citizen
owners
of
these
utilities
in
the
form
of
rate
15


increases
and
lost
capacity;
and
16


WHEREAS,
the
cost
estimate
if
all
287
diesel
17


generators
were
to
be
retrofit
for
compliance
over
a
18


10-year
period
is
$36
million,
which
is
an
average
cost
19


of
$34.14
per
year
per
customer
with
costs
as
high
20


as
$203
per
year
per
customer
or
more,
and
such
cost
21


estimates
would
increase
beyond
this
amount
if
diesel
22


generators
are
replaced
or
taken
out
of
service;
NOW
23


THEREFORE,
24


BE
IT
RESOLVED
BY
THE
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES,
That
25


the
United
States
Environmental
Protection
Agency
is
26


urged
to
rescind
the
national
emissions
standards
for
27


hazardous
air
pollutants
for
reciprocating
internal
28


combustion
engines;
and
29


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
