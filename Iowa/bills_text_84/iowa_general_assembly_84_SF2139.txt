a
rural

2


zone
during
its
participation
in
the
student
loan
repayment
3


program
described
in
the
bill.
The
authority
is
required
to
4


review
the
eligibility
of
each
county
in
this
state
as
a
rural
5


opportunity
zone
at
least
annually.
6


A
county
is
eligible
to
be
designated

a
rural
opportunity
7


zone
if
it

two
of
nine
criteria

the

income,
average
weekly
wages,

The
bill
creates
a
student
loan
repayment
program

for
the
purpose
of
providing
16


student
loan
repayment
assistance
on
the
outstanding
student
17


loan
debt
of
certain
individuals.
The
program
consists
of
a
18


county
component
for
each
participating
county
and
a
matching
19


component
of
the
state.
Qualifying
individuals
may
enroll
in
20


both
the
county
component
and
the
matching
component
of
the
21


student
loan
repayment
program.
22


Each
county
designated
by
the
authority
as
a
rural
23


opportunity
zone
is
eligible
to
create
and
implement
a
county
24


component
within
the
student
loan
repayment
program.
Each
25


county
component
is
required
to
contain
the
uniform
terms
and
26


conditions
prescribed
by
the
authority
and
shall
have
certain
27


minimum
qualifications.
First,
the
county
component
shall
only
28


apply
to
resident
individuals
that
have
outstanding
student
29


loan

county
on

after
the
county

the

component
of
the
program,
31


and

2017.
Second,
the

shall
32


provide
that
participating

are
entitled

full
33


participation
in
the

for
five
years,
provided
34


the
participating
individual

entire
five-year
period.
Third,
the
county
1


component
shall
agree
to
repay,
subject
to
matching
payments
by
2


the
authority
over
a
five-year
period,
the
lesser
of
10
percent
3


of
the
outstanding
student
loan
debt
of
the
participating
4


individual,
or
$7,500
of
the
outstanding

of

the

A
participating

in
the
applicable
county
for
the
entirety
7


of
a
calendar
year
to
receive
repayment
assistance
for
that
8


year.
After
a
county
creates
and
implements
its
county
9


component,
it
is
required
to
provide
a
duly
adopted
resolution
10


to
the
authority
by
January
1,
2013.
The
resolution
shall
be
11


irrevocable
and
shall
obligate
the
county
to
participate
in
the
12


program
for
a
period
of
five
years
per
individual.
13


Participating
individuals
who
remain
domiciled
in
that
14


county
are
eligible
to
receive
repayment
assistance
from
15


the
county
component.
In
addition,
the
authority,
through
16


the
matching
component,
shall
match
each
payment
made
under
17


the
county
component
up
to
the
lesser
of
10
percent
of
the
18


outstanding
student
loan
debt,
or
$7,500
of
the
outstanding
19


student

debt.
The
maximum
amount
of
repayment
assistance
20


that
an
individual
may
receive
under
the
program
shall
not
21


exceed
the
lesser

22


debt
or

23


Matching

from

fund

25


and

of
moneys
in
the
fund.
26


Participating
individuals
are
not
guaranteed
a
right
to
receive
27


repayment
assistance
under
the
program.
A
county
may,
but
is
28


not
required,
to
provide
repayment
assistance
under
its
county
29


component
even
if
insufficient
funds
exist
for
the
authority
30


to
provide
matching
funds.
The
student
loan
repayment
program
31


is
repealed
on
June
30,
2023.
32
