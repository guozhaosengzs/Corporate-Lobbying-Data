EXPLANATION
20


LEGISLATIVE
INTENT.
The
bill
provides
that
it
is
the
21


intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
support
certain
swine
22


confinement
feeding
operations
(facilities
which
house
swine
23


under
a
roof)
and
specifically
sow
reproduction
operations,
24


referred
to
as
a
farrowing
and
gestating
operation.
The
25


general
assembly
declares
an
intent
to
improve
biosecurity
of
26


confinement
feeding
operations
involved
in
the
on-site
raising
27


of
replacement
of
breeding
swine.
28


CURRENT
LAW.
Currently,
special
regulations
apply
to
the
29


storage
of
manure
originating
from
a
so-called
“qualified
30


confinement
feeding
operation”
which
includes
a
farrowing
31


and
gestating
operation.
The
confinement
feeding
operation
32


is
designated
as
qualified
if
the
maximum
number
of
animal
33


units
that
may
be
maintained
there
at
any
one
time
(animal
34


unit
capacity)
equals
2,500
or
more
animal
units
(Code
section

S.F.
2022


459.102).
Generally,
once
classified
as
qualified,
the
1


confinement
feeding
operation
must
store
manure
in
a
structure
2


that
maintains
aeration
equipment
(Code
section
459.206).
3


ANIMAL
UNITS
CALCULATED.
Generally,
an
animal
unit
is
4


calculated
based
on
animal
size.
For
example,
each
head
of
5


breeding
swine
is
equal
to
0.400
animal
units
and
each
head
of
6


swine
weighing
15
pounds
or
more
but
not
more
than
55
pounds
7


is
equal
to
0.100
animal
units.
For
example,
a
person
keeping
8


1,000
sows
would
have
400
animal
units
(1,000
x
.4).
9


RECALCULATING
ANIMAL
UNITS.
The
bill
changes
how
animal
10


units
are
calculated
in
order
to
determine
if
a
confinement
11


feeding
operation
which
includes
a
farrowing
and
gestating
12


operation
is
considered
qualified.
Under
the
bill,
replacement
13


breeding
swine
are
not
counted
if
two
conditions
are
satisfied.
14


First,
the
replacement
breeding
swine
must
be
raised
at
the
15


confinement
feeding
operation
and
second,
the
replacement
16


breeding
swine
must
be
used
in
the
farrowing
and
gestating
17


operation.
