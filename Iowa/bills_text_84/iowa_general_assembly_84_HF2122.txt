vehicle
16


is
a
major
consumer
acquisition
and
that
a
defective
motor
17


vehicle
undoubtedly
creates
a
hardship
for
the
consumer.
The

general
assembly
further
recognizes
that
a
duly
franchised
19


motor
vehicle
or
motor
home


dealer
is
an
authorized
service
20


agent
of
the
manufacturer.
It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
21


assembly
that
a
good
faith
motor
vehicle
warranty
complaint
by
22


a
consumer
be
resolved
by
the
manufacturer
within
a
specified
23


period
of
time.
It
is
further
the
intent
of
the
general
24


assembly
to
provide
the
statutory
procedures
whereby
a
consumer
25


may
receive
a
replacement
motor
vehicle,

EXPLANATION
32


This
bill
relates
to
motor
home
dealer
licensing
and
the
33


business
hours
of
recreational
vehicle
dealers.
34


The
bill
amends
Code
section
322.2
by
adding
a
definition
35


-32-


LSB

H.F.
2122


for
“recreational
vehicle”
which
means
a
motor
home
or
travel
1


trailer.
The
bill
amends
the
definition
of
“motor
vehicle”
for
2


purposes
of
Code
chapter
322
by
excluding
“motor
home”
from
3


the
definition.
The
bill
provides
that
a
person
who
sells
4


recreational
vehicles
is
not
required
to
maintain
regular
5


business
hours
at
the
principal
place
of
business
or
another
6


place
of
business.
The
bill
does
require
a
person
selling
7


recreational
vehicles
to
post
business
contact
information
and
8


a
business
telephone
number
in
a
conspicuous
location
in
the
9


place
of
business.
The
business
telephone
must
be
answered
10


by
an
employee
of
the
dealer
or
by
a
recorded
message
which
11


provides
the
business’s
contact
information.
12


The
bill
requires
motor
home
dealers,
manufacturers,
13


wholesalers,
and
distributors
to
be
licensed
under
Code
14


chapter
322C,
rather
than
Code
chapter
322.
Under
the
bill,
15


the
department
of
transportation
may
employ
employees
as
is
16


necessary
to
administer
the
licensing
requirements
for
motor
17


home
dealers,
manufacturers,
wholesalers,
and
distributors
18


without
the
Code
chapter
322
limitation
that
the
amount
19


expended
in
a
year
cannot
exceed
the
amount
generated.
20


The
bill
amends
Code
chapter
322C.3
to
add
that
the
21


prohibited
acts
therein
apply
to
motor
home
dealers,
22


manufacturers,
and
sales.
Code
chapters
322
and
322C
contain
23


similar
prohibitions
on
a
person
engaging
in
the
sale
of
new
24


vehicles
or
motor
homes
and
used
vehicles
or
motor
homes
and
25


entering
into
contracts
with
manufacturers
or
distributors
for
26


the
motor
vehicles
or
motor
homes.
However,
unlike
in
Code
27


chapter
322,
Code
chapter
322C
does
not
specifically
require
28


the
separate
licensing
of
persons
employed
as
salespersons.
29


The
bill
amends
Code
section
322C.3
to
include
provisions
30


regarding
a
manufacturer
or
distributor’s
retaliatory
action,
31


entrance
into
retail
installment
agreements,
the
sale
of
motor
32


homes
on
Sunday,
fraudulent
practices,
arbitration,
and
the
33


amount
of
compensation.
These
provisions
are
substantially
34


similar
to
provisions
in
Code
section
322.3.

H.F.
2122


Unlike
Code
section
322.3,
the
bill
does
not
prohibit
a
1


person
from
selling
a
motor
home
from
a
location
other
than
2


the
person’s
place
of
business
and
also
does
not
prohibit
a
3


manufacturer
from
having
ownership
or
interest
in
a
dealership.
4


The
bill
amends
Code
section
322C.3
to
provide
that
a
person
5


is
not
required
to
obtain
a
license
as
a
motor
home
dealer
if
6


disposing
of
a
motor
home
so
long
as
the
person
is
exercising
7


a
power
or
right
granted
by
certain
legal
instruments
or
8


agreements.
Code
chapter
322
does
not
contain
a
similar
9


provision.
10


The
bill
amends
Code
section
322C.4
regarding
application
11


for
licensure
as
a
dealer.
Unlike
in
Code
chapter
322,
an
12


application
for
licensure,
under
the
provisions
of
the
bill,
13


would
not
need
to
include
a
statement
of
the
applicant’s
14


previous
history,
a
description
of
the
general
plan,
or
a
15


method
of
doing
business.
16


The
bill
amends
Code
section
322C.4
to
require
a
motor
home
17


dealer
to
furnish
a
surety
bond,
proof
of
financial
liability
18


coverage,
and
certification
of
the
requisite
educational
19


requirements
as
is
required
under
Code
chapter
322.
Unlike
20


in
Code
chapter
322,
the
bill
does
not
provide
requirements
21


for
the
information
included
in
a
dealer
license
once
the
22


license
is
granted.
Additionally,
under
the
provisions
of
the
23


bill,
motor
home
dealer
licensees
would
be
required
to
submit
24


supplemental
statements
within
15
days
and
pay
a
$35
fee.
Code
25


chapter
322
did
not
specify
a
fee
or
the
number
of
days
within
26


which
to
submit
a
supplemental
statement
for
dealer
licenses.
27


The
bill
adds
provisions
to
Code
chapter
322C
regarding
28


temporary
permits
and
display
of
licenses
to
mirror
provisions
29


in
Code
chapter
322.
30


The
bill
amends
Code
section
322C.6,
relating
to
the
denial,
31


suspension,
or
revocation
of
a
dealer
or
manufacturer
license
32


to
add
similar
provisions
to
those
provided
in
Code
section
33


322.6.
Code
chapters
322
and
322C
contain
different
criterion
34


for
denial,
suspension,
or
revocation
of
a
license.

bill
35


-34-


LSB
5198YH

H.F.
2122


amends
Code
section
322C.6
to
add
the
following
reasons
for
1


the
department
to
deny,
revoke,
or
suspend
a
license
that
2


are
contained
in
Code
section
322.9:
failing
to
deliver
a
3


motor
home
upon
its
sale
or
transfer,
failing
to
obtain
a
4


manufacturer’s
or
importer’s
certificate
upon
the
purchase
of
a
5


motor
home,
and
failing
to
obtain
a
new
certificate
of
title.
6


The
bill
amends
Code
chapter
322C
to
add
Code
section
322C.6A
7


regarding
continuing
education
requirements
for
used
motor
home
8


dealers,
referencing
the
specific
provisions
for
such
education
9


in
Code
section
322.7A.
10


The
bill
adds
Code
section
322C.8
regarding
wholesaler
and
11


distributor’s
licenses.
This
provision
is
similar
to
that
12


provided
in
Code
sections
322.27A
and
322.28.
13


The
bill
amends
Code
section
322C.9,
regarding
the
license
14


and
application
fees
for
a
manufacturer
or
distributor
15


to
include
license
and
application
fees
for
motor
home
16


manufacturers,
distributors,
and
wholesalers.
The
additions
17


are
similar
to
that
provided
in
Code
section
322.29.
18


Unlike
in
Code
chapter
322,
which
has
a
penalty
of
a
19


simple
misdemeanor
and
a
fine
for
violation
of
the
chapter,
20


Code
section
322C.11
provides
that
a
person
who
violates
21


the
provisions
regarding
prohibited
acts
of
dealers
and
a
22


manufacturer
or
distributor
engaging
in
business
in
the
state
23


without
a
license
is
guilty
of
a
serious
misdemeanor.
24


The
bill
also
adds
provisions
to
Code
chapter
322C
regarding
25


copy
of
a
contract
to
a
buyer,
dual-interest
insurance,
finance
26


charges,
extension
of
time
in
a
retail
installment
contract,
27


remaining
balance
on
trade
vehicles,
complaints,
hearings,
28


the
construction
and
applicability
to
contracts,
and
the
29


applicability
of
the
Iowa
consumer
credit
code
as
related
to
30


motor
home
sales,
dealers,
manufacturers,
wholesalers,
and
31


distributors.
These
provisions
mirror
those
contained
in
Code
32


chapter
322.
33


Unlike
in
Code
sections
322.10
and
322.11,
the
bill
does
34


not
explicitly
provide
for
judicial
review
of
the
department’s
35

actions
and
injunctions
related
to
motor
home
dealers,
1


manufacturers,
wholesalers,
and
distributors
in
Code
chapter
2


322C.
Code
chapter
322C
also
does
not
explicitly
contain
3


language
allowing
the
department
to
adopt
rules
related
4


to
motor
home
dealers,
manufacturers,
wholesalers,
and
5


distributors.
6


The
bill
also
makes
conforming
amendments
regarding
the
7


licensing
for
motor
homes.
8


The
bill
requires
the
department
of
transportation
to
9


establish
rules
to
implement
the
bill.
The
bill
provides
10


that
the
provisions
of
the
bill
enacting
Code
section
322.2,
11


subsection
14A,
regarding
the
definition
of
recreational
12


vehicles,
and
the
section
amending
Code
section
322.36
13


regarding
dealer
business
hours
are
effective
upon
enactment
14


and
apply
to
all
persons
in
the
business
of
selling
15


recreational
vehicles,
as
defined
by
the
bill.
16


The
bill
applies
to
motor
home
dealers,
manufacturers,
17


wholesalers,
and
distributors
applying
for
initial
