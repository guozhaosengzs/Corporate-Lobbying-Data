EXPLANATION
19


This
bill
relates

of
children.
20


New
Code
section

prohibits
an
employer
from
taking
21


retaliatory
action,
as
defined
in
the
bill,
against
an
employee
22


as
a
reprisal
for
the
employee’s
participation
in
good
faith
23


in
making
a
child
abuse
report,
photograph,
or
X
ray,
or

the

and
25


assisting
in
an
assessment
of
a
child
abuse
report
pursuant
26


to

The
retaliation
prohibition

30


the
retaliation
prohibition
is
liable
to
an
aggrieved
employee
31


and
if
the
person
commits,
is
committing,
or
proposes

commit
32


a
prohibited
retaliation,
an

may
be
granted.
The

amendments.
