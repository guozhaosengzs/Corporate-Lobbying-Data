or

of
this
Act.
15


EXPLANATION
16


This
bill
provides
a
credit
against
the
individual
and
17


corporate
income
taxes,
franchise
tax,
insurance
premiums
tax,
18


and
moneys
and
credits
tax
for
hiring
a
qualified
individual
19


for
employment
in
this
state.
“Qualified
individual”
is
20


defined
as
a
resident
of
this
state
who
is
legally
authorized
21


to
work
in
this
state.
The
credit
is
an
amount
equal
to
$2,000.
22


In
order
to
qualify
for
the
credit,
several
factors
must
be
23


met.
First,
the
taxpayer
must
employ
the
qualified
individual
24


on
a
full-time
basis,
provide
a
sufficient
package
of
benefits,
25


and
pay
the
qualified
individual
at
least
100
percent
of
26


the
qualifying
wage
threshold,
for
12
consecutive
months.
27


The
qualifying
wage
threshold
is
calculated
by
the
economic
28


development
authority
as
provided
in
the
bill.
Second,
29


the
qualified
individual
must
not
have
been
employed
by
the
30


taxpayer
before
the
date
of
hire
and
must
not
have
been
hired
31


to
replace
a
person
whose
employment
was
terminated
within
the
32


last
six
months.
Third,
the
taxpayer
has
received
less
than
33


$200,000
in
Iowans
first
tax
credits.
Fourth,
the
taxpayer
34


must
not
have
a
consistent
pattern
of
violations
of
the
law,
35


-5-


LSB
5467XS

mm/sc
5/

S.F.
2211


including
but
not
limited
to
environmental
and
worker
safety
1


laws.
Fifth,
the
position
for
which
the
qualified
individual
2


was
hired
must
not
have
been
relocated
from
another
area
of
3


this
state
after
the
taxpayer
closed
or
substantially
reduced
4


operations
in
that
area.
Sixth,
the
taxpayer
must
not
be
5


currently
receiving
any
assistance,
incentive,
or
benefit
under
6


the
quality
jobs
enterprise
zone
program
or
the
high
quality
7


jobs
program
for
the
tax
year
in
which
this
credit
is
claimed.
8


To
receive
the
tax
credit,
a
taxpayer
must
submit
an
9


application
to
the
economic
development
authority
and
receive
a
10


tax
credit
certificate,
and
then
attach
the
certificate
to
the
11


taxpayer’s
tax
return.
The
tax
credits
are
nontransferable
and
12


nonrefundable,
but
may
be
carried
forward
for
five
years.
13


The
bill
also
places
the
Iowans
first
tax
credit
under
the
14


aggregate
tax
credit
limit
cap
of
the
economic
development
15


authority
and
allocates
$20
million
of
the
cap
to
the
credit.
16


The
economic
development
authority
is
required
to
issue
17


certificates
so
that
not
more
than
$20
million
in
credits
are
18


claimed
in
any
one
fiscal
year.
Certificates
are
to
be
issued
19


on
an
earliest
filed
basis.
20


An
individual
may
claim
the
tax
credit
allowed
a
21


partnership,
limited
liability
company,
S
corporation,
estate,
22


or
trust
electing
to
have
the
income
taxed
directly
to
the
23


individual.
The
amount
claimed
by
the
individual
shall
be
24


based
upon
the
pro
rata
share
of
the
individual’s
earnings
of
25


the
partnership,
limited
liability
company,
S
corporation,
26


estate,
or
trust.
27


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment
and
applies
to
28


qualified
individuals
hired
on
or
after
that
date.
