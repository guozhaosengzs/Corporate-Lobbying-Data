A

2


WHEREAS,
the

to
the

provides
powers
not
granted
to
the
4


federal
government
nor
prohibited
to
the
states
by
the
5


Constitution
are
reserved
to
the

establishing
6


federalism
and
state

as
integral
founding
7


principles
of
American
government;
and
8


WHEREAS,
the
United
States
Supreme

in
Solid
9


Waste
Agency
of
Northern
Cook
County
v.

States
10


Army
Corps

(2001)
and
in
11


Rapanos
v.
United
States,
547
U.S.
715
(2006)
held
that
12


the
federal
Water
Pollution
Control
Act
(the
Clean
13


Water
Act)
did
not
intend
to
grant
federal
authority
14


over
intrastate
waters
and
that
intrastate
waters
were
15


not
subject
to
regulation
under
the
interstate
commerce
16


clause;
and
17


WHEREAS,
legislation
has
previously
been
introduced
18


in
the
United
States
Congress
to
expand
the
Clean

19


Actâ€™s
jurisdiction
to
include
intrastate
waters;
and
20


WHEREAS,
the
expanded
jurisdiction
under
the
21


proposed
legislation
would
grant
the
United
States
22


Environmental
Protection
Agency
broad
and
vague
23


flexibility
to
interpret
federal
jurisdiction
24


expansively,
which
the
agency
attempted
to
do
under
the
25


current
Clean
Water
Act
and
which

States

Supreme
Court
prevented
the
agency
from
doing;
and
27


WHEREAS,
the
proposed
expanded
jurisdiction
would
28


severely
diminish
state
sovereignty
over
its
natural
1


resources,
and
would
detrimentally
involve
the
federal
2


government
in
an
inefficient
and
cumbersome
effort
3


to
regulate
highly
localized
water
resources
such
as
4


abandoned
pits
and
ponds;
and
5


WHEREAS,
jurisdiction
over
intrastate
water
6


resources
is
a
role
traditionally
held
by
individual
7


state
governments
in
order
to
promote
efficient
and
8


effective
usage
of
intrastate
water
resources;
NOW
9


THEREFORE,
10


BE
IT
RESOLVED
BY
THE
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES,
That
11


the
State
of
Iowa
supports
the
continued
sovereignty
12


and
jurisdiction
of
the
states
to
regulate
intrastate
13


water
resources
and
opposes
any
attempt
by
the
federal
14


government
to
diminish
this
jurisdiction
unnecessarily.
