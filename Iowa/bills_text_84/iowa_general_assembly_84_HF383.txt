EXPLANATION
5


This
bill
enacts
new
Code
section
257.35A,
which
directs
6


state
aid
funding
for
special
education
support
services,
7


media
services,
educational
services,
area
education
agency
8


professional
development
supplement,
and
area
education
agency
9


teacher
salary
supplement
to
the
applicable
school
districts.
10


The
bill
allows
a
school
district
to
provide
its
own
11


services.
A
school
district
may
also
bid
to
provide
services
12


to
other
school
districts.
A
school
district
may
also
solicit
13


bids
from
certain
organizations
to
receive
these
services.
If
14


a
school
district
provides
its
own
special
education
support
15


services,
media
services,
or
educational
services,
it
shall
16


not
receive
funding
that
exceeds
the
amount
determined
under
17


new
Code
section
257.35A.
The
bill
requires
area
education
18


agencies
(AEAs)
and
other
organizations
to
bid
to
provide
19


special
education
support
services,
media
services,
and
20


educational
services.
An
AEA
or
organization
that
successfully
21


bids
to
provide
these
services
to
a
school
district
will
22


receive
the
appropriate
amount
of
funding
from
the
applicable
23


school
district.
The
department
of
education
is
tasked
with
24


developing
the
bid
process
by
rule.
25


Currently,
area
education
agency
funding
operates
pursuant
26


to
a
“flow-through”
concept.
With
no
direct
taxing
authority,
27


AEAs
rely
on
local
school
districts
to
generate
funds
for
their
28


operation.
While
AEA
funding
is
included
within
a
school
29


district’s
budget,
the
district
does
not
actually
receive
30


AEA-related
state
aid
payments.
Instead,
funds
generated
by
31


the
districts
through
the
operation
of
the
school
finance
32


formula
and
earmarked
for
AEAs
are
subtracted
by
the
department
33


of
management
from
the
state
aid
otherwise
due
to
the
district
34


and
are
paid
directly
to
each
AEA.
