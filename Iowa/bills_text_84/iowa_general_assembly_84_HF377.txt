EXPLANATION
15


This
bill
relates
to
community
development.
16


The
bill
includes
the
redevelopment
tax
credits
program
for
17


brownfields
and
grayfields
under
the
department
of
economic
18


development’s
aggregate
tax
credit
limitation
and
makes
19


conforming
changes
to
Code
section
15.293A
in
order
to
allow
20


the
department
to
issue
tax
credits
under
the
program
beginning
21


July
1,
2011.
The
bill
requires
the
department
to
allocate
at
22


least
$5
million
of
its
maximum
aggregate
tax
credit
limitation
23


for
purposes
of
the
program.
Including
the
program
under
24


this
limitation
prevents
the
department
from
carrying
forward
25


unissued
credit
amounts
to
the
next
fiscal
year
allocation.
26


In
2010,
the
general
assembly
authorized
the
department
of
27


natural
resources
to
expend
up
to
$100,000
for
purposes
of
28


providing
grants
to
certain
community
partnership
programs
29


designed
to
support
community
beautification
projects.
The
30


bill
appropriates
an
additional
$200,000
for
such
purposes.
