Short
title.

This
chapter
shall
be
known
and
may
be
cited
as
the
“Stray

Legislative
findings
and
4


intent.
5


The
general
assembly
finds
that
the
efficient
and
safe
6


distribution
of
electricity
is
critical
to
the
well-being
7


of
the
citizens
and
economy
of
this
state,
including
the
8


business
of
agriculture,
and
that
this
chapter
is
necessary
for
9


the
protection
of
the
public
welfare.
The
general
assembly
10


recognizes
that
stray
current
or
voltage
is
a
normal,
inherent,
11


and
unavoidable
result
of
electricity
traveling
through
12


grounded
electrical
systems,
including
a
dairy
producer’s
13


on-farm
system
and
a
utility’s
distribution
system,
which
14


systems
are
required
by
the
national
electrical
code
and
the
15


national
electrical
safety
code
to
be
grounded
to
the
earth
16


to
ensure
continuous
safety
and
reliability.
The
general
17


assembly
finds
that
the
potential
impact
of
stray
current
or
18


voltage
on
dairy
cows
is
a
matter
of
interest
and
concern
to
19


dairy
producers
with
dairies
situated
near
and
served
by
a
20


multigrounded
multiple
exchange
electrical
distribution
system
21


or
similar
electrical
distribution
system
utilized
by
utilities
22


in
this
state.
Scientific
research
has
established
a
level
of
23


stray
current
or
voltage
at
or
below
which
no
effect
on
a
dairy
24


cow’s
behavior,
health,
or
milk
production
has
been
shown.
To
25


provide
for
the
continued
safe
and
efficient
availability
of
26


electricity
while
addressing
complaints
regarding
stray
current
27


or
voltage,
it
is
necessary
and
appropriate
to
establish
a
28


uniform
preventive
action
level;
establish
uniform
procedures
29


and
protocols
for
measurements
of
stray
current
or
voltage;
30


require,
when
necessary,
that
the
sources
of
stray
current
31


or
voltage
be
identified;
require,
when
necessary,
adequate
32


remediation;
and
establish
procedures
for
handling
complaints.

EXPLANATION
5


This
bill
concerns
stray
electric
current
or
voltage,
6


including
the
potential
impact
of
stray
electric
current
or
7


voltage
on
dairy
cows,
and
specifies
procedures
for
adopting
8


rules,
filing
complaints,
measuring
stray
electric
current
or
9


voltage,
taking
corrective
action,
and
pursuing
civil
actions
10


for
damages.
11


The
bill
commences
with
a
statement
of
legislative
intent,
12


noting
that
the
general
assembly
finds
that
the
potential
13


impact
of
stray
current
or
voltage
on
dairy
cows
is
a
matter
of
14


interest
and
concern
to
dairy
producers
with
dairies
situated
15


near
and
served
by
electrical
distribution
systems
utilized
by
16


utilities
in
Iowa,
and
that
scientific
research
has
established
17


a
level
of
stray
current
or
voltage
at
or
below
which
no
effect
18


on
a
dairy
cow’s
behavior,
health,
or
milk
production
has
been
19


shown.
20


The
bill
provides
for
the
adoption
of
administrative
rules
21


by
the
Iowa
utilities
board
establishing
standard
procedures
22


and
protocols
for
the
measurement
of
stray
current
or
voltage.
23


The
bill
states
that
other
measurements
of
stray
current
or
24


voltage
made
using
other
procedures
and
protocols
may
be
25


considered
by
the
board
in
appropriate
cases.
26


The
bill
provides
that
a
dairy
producer
who
claims
that
its
27


dairy
cows
are
being
affected
by
any
form
or
type
of
electrical
28


energy
allegedly
attributable
to
a
utility
including,
without
29


limitation,
stray
current
or
voltage,
shall,
before
commencing
30


any
civil
action
against
the
utility,
provide
written
notice
31


to
the
utility
specifying
why
the
dairy
producer
believes
its
32


dairy
cows
are
being
affected
by
electrical
energy
attributable
33


to
the
utility.
Within
14
business
days
of
receipt
of
the
34


notice,
if
the
notice
alleges
stray
current
or

bill
directs
the
utility
to
make
arrangements
to
take
or
cause
1


measurements
to
be
taken
at
cow
contact
points
at
the
dairy
2


producer’s
dairy
to
identify
the
existence
and
magnitude
of
3


stray
current
or
voltage,
if
any.
The
bill
states
that
if
a
4


level
of
stray
current
or
voltage
in
excess
of
a
specified
5


preventive
action
level
is
determined,
the
utility
must
6


identify
that
portion
which
is
attributable
to
the
utility’s
7


distribution
system.
If
the
portion
of
the
stray
current
or
8


voltage
at
cow
contact
points
attributable
to
the
utility’s
9


distribution
system
exceeds
50
percent
of
the
preventive
action
10


level,
the
bill
requires
the
utility,
within
15
business
days,
11


to
commence
and
diligently
pursue
to
completion
remedial
12


procedures
which
shall
reduce,
and
are
reasonably
likely
to
13


sustain,
that
portion
of
the
stray
current
or
voltage
at
cow
14


contact
points
attributable
to
the
utility’s
distribution
15


system
to
50
percent
or
less
of
the
preventive
action
level.
16


The
bill
provides
that
the
board
shall
have
exclusive,
17


initial
jurisdiction
regarding
complaints
by
dairy
producers
18


and
actions
by
utilities.
Upon
receiving
a
request
from
a
19


dairy
producer
to
review
such
actions,
the
board
shall
conduct
20


a
contested
case
proceeding
to
determine
whether
a
utility
has
21


complied
with
the
rules
regarding
measurement
of
stray
current
22


or
voltage,
whether
the
utility’s
measurements
demonstrated
23


stray
current
or
voltage
at
or
above
the
preventive
action
24


level,
whether
any
other
measurements
demonstrated
stray
25


current
or
voltage
at
or
above
the
preventive
action
level,
26


whether
the
utility
has
properly
identified
that
portion
of
the
27


stray
current
or
voltage
at
cow
contact
points
attributable
28


to
the
utility’s
distribution
system,
and
whether
the
utility
29


has
complied
with
its
remediation
obligation.
The
board
is
30


authorized
to
arrange
for
third-party
measurement
of
stray
31


current
or
voltage
if
the
board
determines
it
reasonable

32


so.
33


The
bill
provides,
pursuant
to
a
contested
case
proceeding,
34


for
the
issuance
of
orders
by
the
board.

the
preventive
action
level,
the
board
10


may
issue
an
order
that
the
utility
provided
adequate
service.
11


If
a
utility
complied
with
the
rules
regarding
measurement
of
12


stray
current
or
