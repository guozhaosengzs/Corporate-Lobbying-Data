program
(formerly,
the
grow
Iowa

values
fund
and
program),
which
is
repealed
June
30,
2012,
with
3


some
modifications.
The
bill
transfers
the
definitions
of
4


“created
job”,
“maintenance
period
completion
date”,
“retained
5


job”,
“financial
assistance”,
“full-time
equivalent
position”,
6

and
“project

The
bill
transfers
the
definitions
of
“benefit”,
“fiscal

threshold”,
and
“base

level”
from
Code
section
11


15G.101
to
Code
section
15.327,
with
modifications.
The
bill
12


changes
the
definition
of
“benefit”
by
providing
that
the
13


economic
development
board,
rather
than
the
authority,
shall
14


determine
any
other
nonwage
compensation
that
is
considered
a
15


benefit.
The
bill
changes
the
calculation
of
a
“fiscal
impact
16


ratio”.
The
estimated
taxes
to
be
received
by
the
state
from
a
17


business
would
be
divided
by
the
estimated
cost
to
the
state
of
18


providing
certain
project
completion
assistance
and
incentives
19


to
the
business
rather
than
dividing
the
estimated
taxes
by
20


the
cost
of
providing
financial
incentives
to
the
business.
21


The
bill
amends
the
definition
of
“project
completion
date”
22


to
provide
that
the
person
may
be
a
recipient
of
project
23


completion
assistance
rather
than
financial
assistance.
The
24


bill
amends
the
definition
of
“qualifying
wage
threshold”.
25


The
bill
provides
that
the
qualifying
wage
threshold
means
26


the
“laborshed
wage”
as
defined
in
the
bill
rather
than
the
27


county
or
regional
wage.
The
bill
provides
that
the
“base
28


employment
level”
is
calculated
as
of
the
date
the
business
29


applies
for
incentives
or
project
completion
assistance
rather
30


than
financial
assistance.
31


The
bill
also
adds
definitions
for
“business
engaged
in
32


disaster
recovery”,
“fund”,
“laborshed
wage”,
“necessary
33


physical

project”,
“program

bill
provides
that
a
“business
engaged
in
disaster
recovery”
1


means
a
business
located
in
a
federally
declared
disaster
2


area
that
sustained
substantial
physical
damage
and
closed
3


as
a
result
of
the
disaster,
but
has
a
plan
for
reopening
4


that
includes
employing
a
substantial
number
of
the
employees
5


the
business
employed
before
the
natural
disaster.
The
bill
6


provides
that
“fund”
means
a
fund
created
pursuant
to
new
Code
7


section
15.335B.
The
bill
provides
that
“laborshed
wage”
means
8


the
wage
level
represented
by
those
wages
within
two
standard
9


deviations
from
the
mean
wage
within
the
laborshed
area,
as
10


calculated
by
the
authority.
The
bill
defines
“necessary
11


physical
infrastructure
project”
as
a
project
creating
12


necessary
infrastructure
for
economic
success
by
providing
13


the
foundation
for
job
creation,
and
involving
investment
of
14


capital.
The
bill
defines
“program
support”
as
the
services
15


necessary
for
the
efficient
administration
of
the
high
quality
16


jobs
program.
The
bill
defines
“project
completion
assistance”
17


as
financial
or
technical
assistance
provided
to
an
eligible
18


business
to
facilitate
the
start-up,
location,
or
expansion
of
19


the
business.
20


The
bill
strikes
the
definitions
for
“benefits”,
“county
21


wage”,
“qualifying
wage
threshold”,
and
“regional
wage”
as
used
22


in
Code
section
15.335A,
as
those
definitions
placed
by
the
23


bill
in
Code
section
15.327
also
apply
to
Code
section
15.335A.
24


The
bill
amends
Code
section
15.329
regarding
qualifying
25


wage
thresholds
for
eligible
businesses.
The
current
law
26


requires
that
any
jobs
created
or
retained
pay
at
least
27


130
percent
of
the
qualifying
wage
threshold
at
the
project
28


completion
date
until
the
maintenance

date.
The
bill
provides
that
a
business
eligible
to
receive
30


incentives
or
assistance
for
creating
or
retaining
jobs
must
31


pay
at
least
120
percent
of
the
qualifying
wage
threshold
32


at
the
project
completion
date
until
the
maintenance

date.
The

also

However,
the

paying
less
than
120
percent
but
at
least
100

of
the
3


qualifying
wage
threshold
if
the
business
is
located
in
an
4


economically
distressed
area.
An
