new
requirement
that
a
retail
dealer
cannot
advertise,
sell,
or
13


dispense
gasoline
other
than
ethanol
blended
gasoline;
either
14


standard
ethanol
blended
gasoline
or
so-called
E-85
gasoline.
15


Gasoline
which
does
not
contain
the
requisite
percentage
of
16


ethanol
is
referred
to
as
“unblended
gasoline”.
17


EXCEPTIONS.
Notwithstanding
the
prohibition,
the
bill
18


allows
a
retail
dealer
to
continue
to
advertise,
sell,
or
19


dispense
unblended
gasoline
in
limited
circumstances.
First,
20


the
prohibition
does
not
apply
to
gasoline
used
to
operate
21


aircraft,
or
motor
vehicles
involved
exclusively
in
motor
22


sports
events.
The
requirement
also
does
not
apply
to
23


gasoline
for
use
in
certain
vehicles
such
as
antique
vehicles,
24


snowmobiles,
all-terrain
vehicles,
watercraft,
and
small
25


motors.
The
bill
prohibits
a
retail
dealer
from
using
more
26


than
one
metered
pump
to
dispense
unblended
gasoline.
Second,
27


the
prohibition
does
not
apply
to
a
retail
dealer
who
has
been
28


issued
a
waiver
by
the
department
because
the
retail
dealer
has
29


not
been
able
to
reasonably
obtain
ethanol
blended
gasoline
for
30


sale
at
the
retail
motor
fuel
site.
The
waiver
expires
six
31


months
from
the
date
of
issuance.
However,
a
retail
dealer
who
32


has
been
issued
a
waiver
may
apply
for
any
number
of
subsequent
33


waivers.
Third,
a
retail
dealer
may
continue
to
advertise,
34


sell,
or
dispense
unblended
gasoline
from
one
or
more
metered

pumps
located
at
a
retail
motor
fuel
site
until
January

2012.
2


ADVERTISING.
The
bill
provides
that
a
retail
dealer
must
3


affix
a
decal
on
each
metered
pump
which
dispenses
unblended
4


gasoline,
notifying
the
public
of
its
designation
and
any
5


restricted
use.
The
bill
eliminates
a
requirement
that
a
6


metered
pump
dispensing
ethanol
blended
gasoline
be
affixed
7


with
a
decal.
8


APPLICABLE
PENALTIES.
Code
section
214A.11
provides
that
9


a
person
who
violates
a
provision
of
Code
chapter
214A
is
10


guilty
of
a
serious
misdemeanor,
and
that
each
day
that
a
11


continuing
violation
occurs
is
considered
a
separate
offense.
12


A
serious
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
13


more
than
one
year
and
a
fine
of
at
least
$315
but
not
more
14


than
$1,875.
The
Code
section
also
provides
that
in
lieu
of
15


seeking
a
prosecution,
the
state
may
proceed
against
the
person
16


by
initiating
an
alternative
civil
enforcement
action
as
a
17


contested
case
proceeding
by
the
department
under
Code
chapter
18


17A
or
as
a
civil
judicial
proceeding
by
the
attorney
general
19


upon
referral
by
the
department.
The
applicable
civil
penalty
20


is
at
least
$100
but
not
more
than
$1,000
for
each
violation.
21


Each
day
that
a
continuing
violation
occurs
shall
be
considered
22


a
separate
offense.
23


E-15
PROMOTION
TAX
CREDIT.
The
bill
amends
the
ethanol
24


promotion
tax
credit
which
is
calculated
separately
for
each
25


retail
motor
fuel
site
from
which
the
retail
dealer
sells
and
26


dispenses
ethanol
blended
gasoline
(Code
sections
422.11N
and
27


422.33,
subsection
11A).
The
tax
credit
rate
depends
upon
the
28


number
of
gallons
of
ethanol
blended
gasoline
and
biodiesel
29


blended
fuel
that
a
retail
dealer
sold
throughout
a
calendar
30


year
(referred
to
as
a
determination
period).
The
amount
of
31


the
tax
credit
depends
upon
whether
the
retail
dealer
met
that
32


biofuel
threshold.
This
bill
renames
the
tax
credit
as
the
33


E-15
promotion
tax
credit,
and
provides
that
the
tax
credit
34


applies
only
to
those
gallons
of
ethanol
blended
gasoline
35

designated
as

or
higher.
It
also
allows
a
retail
dealer
1


filing
a
tax
return
on
a
noncalendar
year
basis
to
claim
the
2


tax
credit.
The
tax
credit
is
eliminated
on
January
1,
2021.
3


REPORTING.
The
bill
also
amends
reporting
requirements
4


by
retail
dealers
and
the
department
of
revenue.
A
retail
5


dealer’s
report
calculates
the
total
motor
fuel
gallonage,
6


and
further
divides
that
number
based
on
a
number
of
7


classifications
depending
upon
the
type
of
motor
fuel
sold,
8


including
ethanol
blended
gasoline
gallonage.
The
department
9


then
calculates
the
aggregate
total
for
the
motor
fuel
10


gallonage
including
by
classification
for
the
determination
11


period.
The
bill
revises
the
reporting
classifications
for
12


ethanol
blended
gasoline,
by
including
subclassifications
for
13


E-9
and
E-10,
E-11
to
E-15,
and
E-16
to
E-85.
It
provides
that
14


the
department
may
establish
additional
subclassifications.
15


The
bill’s
provisions
related
to
tax
credit
and
reporting
16


requirements
are
effective
on
January
1,
2012,
and
tax
credit
17


provisions
are
applicable
to
the
tax
years
beginning
on
or
18


after
that
date.
