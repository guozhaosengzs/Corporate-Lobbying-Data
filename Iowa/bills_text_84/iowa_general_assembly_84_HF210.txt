EXPLANATION
21


The
department
of
cultural
affairs
is
responsible
for
22


administering
the
Iowa
cultural
resources
survey
and
23


registration
program
which
is
to
be
operated
in
accordance
with
24


federal
law.
Site
surveys
of
proposed
routes
of
construction
25


that
have
the
potential
to
impact
historic
properties
may
be
26


requested
under
this
program
if
federal
funds
are
used
to
27


finance
the
construction.
28


This
bill
establishes
specific
standards
for
surveys
29


by
rural
electric
cooperatives.
The
bill
requires
a
rural
30


electric
cooperative
to
perform
a
site
survey
only
when
a
31


historic
property
is
likely
to
exist
on
the
property.
The
32


survey
itself
must
be
a
reasonable
and
good
faith
effort,
33


balancing
the
impacts
on
the
historic
property
and
the
project
34


costs.
