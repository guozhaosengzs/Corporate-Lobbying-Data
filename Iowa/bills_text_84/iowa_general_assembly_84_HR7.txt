member’s
specific
employment,
specific
investment,
or
1


other
specific
interest,
as
opposed
to
the
interests
of

the

in
general
or
the
interests
of
a
profession,
3


trade,
business,
or
other
class
of
persons,
shall
be
4


avoided.
In
making
a
decision
relative
to
a
member’s
5


activity
on
particular
bills
or
in
committee
work,
the
6


following
factors
should
be
considered:
7


a.
Whether
a
substantial
threat
to
the
member’s
8


independence
of
judgment
has
been
created
by
the
9


conflict
situation.
10


b.
The
effect
of
the
member’s
participation
on
11


public
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the
general
12


assembly.
13


c.
Whether
the
member’s
participation
is
likely
to
14


have
any
significant
effect
on
the
disposition
of
the
15


matter.
16


d.
The
need
for
the
member’s
particular
17


contribution,
such
as
special
knowledge
of
the
subject
18


matter,
to
the
effective
functioning
of
the
general
19


assembly.
20


If
a
member
decides
not
to
participate
in
committee
21


work
or
to
abstain
from
voting
because
of
a
possible
22


conflict
of
interest,
the
member
should
disclose
23


this
fact
to
the
legislative
body.
The
member
shall
24


not
vote
on
any
question
in
which
the
member
has
an
25


economic
interest
that
is
distinguishable
from
the
26


interests
of
the
general
public
or
a
substantial
class
27


of
persons.
