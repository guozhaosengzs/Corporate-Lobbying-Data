H.F.

This
bill
provides
an
exemption
from
motor
vehicle
1


registration
and
from
sales
tax
for
minibikes
used
in
2


agricultural
production.
3


The
bill
defines
“minibike”
as
a
small
two-wheeled
4


motorcycle
with
a
low
frame
and
elevated
handlebars
designed
to
5


transport
only
one
person
and
not
primarily
manufactured
for
6


highway
use.
The
bill
provides
that
such
a
motor
vehicle
is
7


considered
an
implement
of
husbandry
if
it
is
used
exclusively
8


for
agricultural
purposes
and,
except
for
incidental
uses,
9


exclusively
used
in
the
conduct
of
agricultural
operations.
10


Pursuant
to
current
law,
a
vehicle
which
is
an
implement
11


of
husbandry
is
not
subject
to
motor
vehicle
registration
12


requirements
and
is
exempt
from
payment
of
motor
vehicle
13


registration
fees.
This
current
exemption
from
motor
vehicle
14


registration
requirements
and
fees
would
apply
to
a
minibike
15


that
qualifies
for
registration
as
a
motorcycle
and
also
meets
16


the
requirements
for
an
implement
of
husbandry.
17


Minibikes
that
do
not
meet
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
18


standards
for
motor
vehicles
operated
on
highways
are
currently
19


subject
to
state
sales
tax.
The
bill
provides
an
exemption
20


from
the
state
sales
tax
for
minibikes
used
as
implements
of
21


husbandry.
