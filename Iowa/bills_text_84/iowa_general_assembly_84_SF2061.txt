EXPLANATION
6


This
bill
establishes
new
regulations
to
permit
increased
7


access
to
surplus
lines
insurance
in
the
state,
and
contains
8


penalties,
coordinating
provisions,
repeals,
and
effective
date
9


provisions.
10


The
bill
creates
new
Code
chapter
515I
which
contains
11


regulations
that
permit
the
sale
of
surplus
lines
insurance
12


in
the
state
by
insurers
who
are
not
licensed
to
do
insurance
13


business
in
the
state.
Such
insurers
shall
be
listed
as
14


eligible
surplus
lines
insurers
if
they
meet
the
requirements
15


of
the
Code
chapter
and
are
approved
to
sell
such
insurance
by
16


the
commissioner
of
insurance.
17


Surplus
lines
insurance
producers
that
are
licensed
pursuant
18


to
Code
chapter
522B
to
sell,
solicit,
or
negotiate
surplus
19


lines
insurance
are
also
subject
to
new
regulations
and
must
20


file
reports
and
remit
premium
taxes
to
the
state
for
all
21


surplus
lines
insurance
sold
or
delivered
by
the
producer,
as
22


required
by
the
commissioner
by
rule.
A
payment
of
premium
to
23


a
producer
is
deemed
to
be
payment
to
the
insurer.
24


Surplus
lines
insurance
producers
may
sell
insurance
issued
25


by
an
insurer
that
is
not
admitted
to
do
business
in
this
26


state
if
the
insurer
is
an
eligible
surplus
lines
insurer,
the
27


insurer
is
authorized
to
write
the
type
of
insurance
being
sold
28


in
its
domiciliary
jurisdiction,
and
a
diligent
search
by
the
29


producer
indicates
that
the
type
of
insurance
being
sold
cannot
30


be
obtained
from
an
insurer
admitted
to
do
insurance
business
31


in
this
state.
Surplus
lines
insurance
producers
may
sell
32


commercial
surplus
lines
insurance,
without
determining
whether
33


the
coverage
is
available
from
an
insurer
admitted
to
do
34


business
in
the
state,

purchasers

that
employ
qualified
risk
managers
to
negotiate

and
meet
certain
financial
and
size
parameters.
2


When
this
state
is
the
home
state
of
the
insured,
a
person
3


who
procures
surplus
lines
insurance
independently
without
4


using
the
services
of
a
surplus
lines
insurance
producer
is
5


required
to
file
a
written
report
about
the
transaction
and
6


pay
the
appropriate
premium
taxes
that
are
due
in
the
manner
7


that
is
required
by
the
commissioner
by
rule.
Delinquent
taxes
8


shall
be
increased
by
a
penalty
of
1
percent
per
month
of
the
9


delinquent
amount.
10


The
commissioner
may
declare
a
nonadmitted
insurer
11


ineligible
to
place
surplus
lines
insurance
in
the
state
if
12


the
commissioner
believes
that
the
insurer
is
in
an
unsound
13


financial
condition
or
has
acted
in
an
untrustworthy
manner;
14


no
longer
meets
the
requirements
of
Code
chapter
515I;
has
15


willfully
violated
Iowa
law;
does
not
conduct
its
claims
16


settlement
practices
in
a
fair
and
reasonable
manner;
or
has
17


committed
an
unfair
or
deceptive
trade
practice
under
Code
18


chapter
507B.
19


The
commissioner
may
also
suspend,
revoke,
or
refuse
to
20


renew
the
license
of
a
surplus
lines
insurance
producer
or
21


impose
any
penalty
under
Code
chapter
507B
for
specified
22


reasons.
The
commissioner
may
initiate
an
administrative
23


proceeding
against
a
surplus
lines
insurance
producer
for
24


the
collection
of
unpaid
premium
taxes
and
assess
a
penalty
25


of
1
percent
per
month
of
the
delinquent
amount.
A
person
26


who
represents
or
aids
a
nonadmitted
insurer
in
violation
of
27


the
new
Code
chapter
is
subject
to
criminal
penalties.
Upon
28


a
determination
by
the
commissioner
that
a
surplus
lines
29


producer,
an
eligible
surplus
lines
insurance
insurer,
or
30


a
nonadmitted
insurer
is
violating
or
about
to
violate
the
31


provisions
of
Code
chapter
515I,
the
commissioner
may
issue
a
32


summary
order
