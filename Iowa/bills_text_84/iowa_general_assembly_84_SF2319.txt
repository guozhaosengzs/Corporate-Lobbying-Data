subsection

Code
Supplement

2011,
is
amended
to
read
as
follows:
2


2.
In
the
event
market
value
of
the
property
being
assessed
3


cannot
be
readily
established
in
the
foregoing
manner,
then
4


the
assessor
may
determine
the
value
of
the
property
using
the
5


other
uniform
and
recognized
appraisal
methods
including
its
6


productive
and
earning
capacity,
if
any,
industrial
conditions,
7


its
cost,
physical
and
functional
depreciation
and
obsolescence
8


and
replacement
cost,
and
all
other
factors
which
would
assist
9


in
determining
the
fair
and
reasonable
market
value
of
the
10


property
but
the
actual
value
shall
not
be
determined
by
use
11


of
only
one
such
factor.
The
following
shall
not
be
taken
into
12


consideration:
Special
value
or
use
value
of
the
property
to
13


its
present
owner,
and
the
goodwill
or
value
of
a
business
14


which
uses
the
property
as
distinguished
from
the
value
of
the
15


property
as
property.
However,
in
assessing
property
that
16


is
rented
or
leased
to
low-income
individuals
and
families
17


pursuant
to
criteria
of
the
HOME
investment
partnerships


18


program
of
the
federal
National
Affordable
Housing
Act
of
19


1990
or
as
authorized
by
section
42
of
the
Internal
Revenue
20


Code,
as
amended,
and
which
section


limits
the
amount
that
the
21


individual
or
family
pays
for
the
rental
or
lease
of
units
22


in
the
property,
the
assessor
shall
use
the
productive
and
23


earning
capacity
from
the
actual
rents
received
as
a
method
of
24


appraisal
and
shall
take
into
account
the
extent
to
which
that
25


use
and
limitation
reduces
the
market
value
of
the
property.
26


The
assessor
shall
not
consider
any
tax
credit
equity
or
other
27


subsidized
financing
as
income
provided
to
the
property
in
28


determining
the
assessed
value.
The
property
owner
shall
29


notify
the
assessor
when
property
is
withdrawn
from
the
federal


30


HOME
investment
partnership
program
eligibility
or


section
42
31


eligibility
under
the
Internal
Revenue
Code.
The
property
32


shall
not
be
subject
to
section
42
such
assessment
procedures
33


for
the
assessment
year
for
which
section
42


eligibility
is
34


withdrawn.
This
notification
must
be
provided
to
the
assessor

3


time
and
in
the
same
manner
as

property
taxes.
Upon
4

of
uniform
rules
by
the
department
of
revenue
or
5


succeeding
authority
covering
assessments
and
valuations
of
6

purposes
to
assure
uniformity,
but
such
rules,
11


forms,
and
guidelines
shall
not
be
inconsistent
with

12


the

the
actual,
market,

EXPLANATION
15


Under
Code
section
441.21(2),
property
that
is
rented
or
16


leased
to
low-income
individuals
and
families
as
authorized
by
17


section
42
of
the
Internal
Revenue
Code
and
that
is
limited
18


in
the
amount
that
the
individual
or
family
pays
for
the
19


rental
or
lease,
is
assessed
for
property
tax
purposes
based
20


on
productive
and
earning
capacity
from
the
actual
rents
and
21


such
assessment
takes
into
account
the
extent
to
which
that
use
22


and
limitation
reduces
the
market
value
of
the
property.
In
23


addition,
the
assessor
is
prohibited
from
considering
any
tax
24


credit
equity
or
other
subsidized
financing
as
income
provided
25


to
the
property
in
determining
the
assessed
value.
26


This
bill
requires
property
that
is
rented
or
leased
to
27


low-income
individuals
and
families
under
criteria
of
the
28


HOME
investment
partnership
program
of
the
federal
National
29


Affordable
Housing
Act
of
1990
to
be
assessed
in
the
same
30


manner
as
properties
under
section
42
of
the
31


Internal
Revenue
Code
are
assessed.
