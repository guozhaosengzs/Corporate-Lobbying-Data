This

relates
to
the

of
dispositional

in
15


juvenile
court
due
to
the
commission
of
a
delinquent
act.
16


The
bill
provides
that
a
dispositional
order
entered
prior
17


to
a
child
turning
17
years
of
age,
for
a
child
ordered
to
18


undergo
mental

or
substance

may

18
years
of

21


achieved,
whichever

22


Under
current
law,
all
dispositional
orders
entered
in
23


juvenile
court
for
a
child
under
17
years
of
age
terminate
when
24


the

except
for
certain
instances
25


when
the

is
required
to

also
allows

dispositional
order
entered
27


between
when
a
child
turns
17
years
of
age
and
18
years
of
age
28


shall
automatically
terminate
one
year
and
six
months
after
the
29


date
of
disposition.
30


A
dispositional
order
in
juvenile

is
similar
to
a
31


sentencing
order
in
district
court.
