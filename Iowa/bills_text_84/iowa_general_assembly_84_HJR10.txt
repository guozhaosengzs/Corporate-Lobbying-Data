EXPLANATION
8


This
joint
resolution
proposes
an
amendment
to
the
9


Constitution
of
the
State
of
Iowa
relating
to
term
of
service
10


for
persons
elected
to
the
offices
of
representative
or
senator
11


in
the
general
assembly.
The
amendment
provides
that
any
12


person
elected
as
a
representative
shall
be
eligible
to
serve
13


eight
consecutive
terms
in
that
position,
but
shall
not
be
14


eligible
to
serve
a
ninth
consecutive
term.
The
amendment
15


provides
that
any
person
elected
as
a
senator
shall
be
eligible
16


to
serve
four
consecutive
terms
in
that
position,
but
shall
not
17


be
eligible
to
serve
a
fifth
consecutive
term.
The
amendment
18


therefore
limits
the
offices
of
representatives
and
senators
19


to
16
consecutive
years
of
service.
The
amendment
provides
20


that
a
resignation
from
either
of
these
positions
alone
would
21


not
serve
to
break
the
counting
of
consecutive
terms.
The
22


limitation
on
consecutive
years
of
service
shall
commence
with
23


terms
of
office
beginning
on
or
after
January
1,
2017.
24


The
resolution,
if
adopted,
would
be
referred
to
the
next
25


general
assembly
for
adoption
before
being
submitted
to
the
26


electorate
for
ratification.
