EXPLANATION
9


This
bill
provides
that
a
parent
may,
on
behalf
of
the
10


parent’s
minor
child,
release
or
waive
such
minor
child’s
11


prospective
claim
for
negligence
as
long
as
the
claim
does
not
12


involve
willful,
reckless,
or
grossly
negligent
behavior.
13


In
Galloway
v.
State
(No.
08-0776,
filed
November
5,
2010),
14


the
Iowa
Supreme
Court
concluded
that
preinjury
releases
15


executed
by
parents
waiving
prospective
personal
injury
claims
16


of
their
minor
children
violate
public
policy
and
are
therefore
17


unenforceable.
