EXPLANATION
25


This
bill
relates
to
certain
duties
and
operations
of
26


governmental
entities
and
related
enforcement
actions.
The
27


bill
is
designated
as
the
“Restructure
or
Eliminate
Frivolous,
28


Obsolete,
and
Redundant
Mandates
in
Governments
Act”.
The
29


bill
states
that
it
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
30


examine
all
frivolous,
obsolete,
and
redundant
mandates
in
31


all
levels
of
government
and
take
all
necessary
actions
to
32


restructure
or
eliminate
such
mandates.
33


Under
Code
section
26.3
relating
to
competitive

34


for

paper
copies
of
the
1


project’s
contract
documents,
including
all
drawings,
plans,
2


specifications,
and
estimated
total
costs.
The
bill
strikes
3


the
prohibition
on
governmental
entities
charging
for
providing
4


such
items
to
prospective
bidders,
subcontractor
bidders,
5


suppliers,
and
contractor
plan
room
services.
6


Current
Code
section
29B.59
provides
that
city
or
county
7


jails
and
other
jails,
penitentiaries,
or
prisons
must
receive
8


persons
ordered
into
confinement
by
a
military
court
and
9


prohibits
such
jails,
penitentiaries,
or
prisons
from
requiring
10


payment
of
a
fee
or
charge
for
receiving
or
confining
the
11


person.
The
bill
allows
such
jails,
penitentiaries,
or
prisons
12


to
require
a
reasonable
fee
or
charge
in
such
situations.
13


Current
Code
section
142.3
requires
a
county
medical
14


examiner,
funeral
director
or
embalmer,
and
the
managing
15


officer
of
every
public
asylum,
hospital,
county
care
facility,
16


penitentiary,
or
reformatory,
as
soon
as
any
dead
body
shall
17


come
into
the
person’s
custody
which
may
be
used
for
scientific
18


purposes
to
notify
the
nearest
relative
or
friend
of
the
19


deceased,
if
known,
and
the
Iowa
department
of
public
health
20


by
telegram.
The
bill
allows
such
notification
to
occur
by
a
21


secure
notification
format
approved
by
the
department
of
public
22


health.
23


The
bill
removes
the
county
registrar
(county
recorder)
from
24


the
list
of
persons
who
may
issue
a
burial
transit
permit.
25


The
bill
removes
the
county
attorney
from
those
persons
26


required
to
enforce
Code
chapter
191
(oleomargarine
law).
27


The
bill
repeals
Code
sections
207.11
and
208.21
relating
to
28


agencies,
political
subdivisions,
and
publicly
owned
utilities
29


or
corporations
that
engage
in
certain
mining
activities.
Code
30


sections
207.11
and
208.21
subject
such
entities
that
engage
in
31


mining
to
similar
mining
regulations
as
other
mining
entities.
32


Code
section
217.32
requires
the
counties

that
are
assigned
to
duties
in
the
county.
Code
section
217.32
1


further
provides
that
the
department
of
human
services
shall
2


reimburse
the
county
for
a
portion
of
such
costs
that
is
3


equivalent
to
the
proportion
of
those
costs
which
the
federal
4


government
authorizes
to
be
paid
unless
the
general
assembly
5


directs
otherwise.
The
bill
requires
reimbursement
to
the
6


county
of
the
total
cost
of
maintaining
the
office
space
and
7


providing
supplies
and
equipment.
8


The
bill
repeals
several
Code
sections
relating
to
the
9


disposition
of
certain
state-owned
buildings
and
school
sites
10


(provided
by
state
mining
camp
funds
for
schools
in
mining
11


camps).
The
bill
provides
that
such
property
may
be
sold
at
12


public
or
private
sale
by
the
department
of
education
when
the
13


director
of
the
department
of
education
determines
that
it
is
14


no
longer
needed
for
school
purposes.
15


The
bill
amends
provisions
relating
to
the
compilation
of
a
16


code
of
ordinances
by
each
county
under
Code
section
331.302
17


and
each
city
under
Code
section
380.8.
The
bill
allows
such
18


compilation
and
related
supplements
to
be
accomplished
by
the
19


use
of
electronic
means
and
electronic
publication.
The
bill
20


also
permits
cities
and
counties
to
make
certain
standards
and
21


codes
adopted
by
reference
available
on
the
entity’s
internet
22


site.
23


The
bill
strikes
a
requirement
that
the
county
recorder
24


carry
out
duties
relating
to
the
recordation
of
articles
of
25


incorporation
and
other
instruments
for
savings
and
loan
26


associations
as
provided
in
Code
chapter
534.
27


The
bill
strikes
a
provision
classifying
an
unexpected
death
28


as
a
death
which
affects
the
public
interest.
If
a
death
29


is
classified
as
a
death
that
affects
the
public
interest,
30


the
state
or
county
medical
examiner
must
be
notified
and
a
31


preliminary
investigation
of
the
death
must
be
conducted.
32


Code
section
356.49
requires
the
county
sheriff
to
file
a
33


monthly
written
report
with
the
director
of
the
department
of
34


corrections
relating

The
bill
allows
the
director
of
the
department
of
1


corrections
to
require
electronic
filing
of
such
reports.
2


As
a
condition
of
the
general
permit
under
Code
section
3


455B.103A,
a
person
proposing
to
conduct
activities
covered
4


by
a
general
permit
is
required
to
provide
notice
of
intent
5


to
conduct
a
covered
activity
to
the
department
of
natural
6


resources.
The
bill
strikes
the
additional
notice
requirement
7


of
publication
in
two
newspapers
with
the
largest
circulation
8


in
the
area
and
the
requirement
that
such
notices
be
provided
9


and
published
when
such
activities
are
discontinued.
10


The
bill
allows
certain
manure
management
plans
that
are
11


required
to
be
delivered
to
a
county
board
of
supervisors
under
12


Code
section
459.312(4)
to
be
delivered
electronically.
13


The
bill
specifies
that
notices
provided
by
the
county
14


auditor
under
Code
section
468.14,
relating
to
the
approval
15


of
a
proposed
levee
and
drainage
district
plan
and
engineer’s
16


report,
must
include
a
statement
describing
the
favorable
17


report
of
the
engineer.
Such
notice
must
also
include
a
18


statement
describing
the
location
and
times
that
the
engineer’s
19


report
may
be
reviewed
at
either
a
county
office
or
on
a
county
20


internet
site.
21


The
bill
provides
that
in
proceedings
under
Code
chapter
22


600B
(paternity
and
obligations
for
support)
if
the
finding
of
23


the
court
is
in
favor
of
the
defendant
the
costs
of
the
action
24


shall
be
paid
by
the
complainant,
unless
the
complainant
is
25


deemed
indigent,
then
the
costs
of
the
action
are
paid
by
the
26


county.
27


The
bill
strikes
the
requirement
for
counties
to
issue
28


going-out-of-business
sale
permits
for
such
sales
