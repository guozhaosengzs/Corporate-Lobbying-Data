to
enact
campaign
finance
1


restrictions
relating
to

3


WHEREAS,
the
protections
afforded
by
the
First
4


Amendment
of
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
5


to
the
people
of
our
nation
are
fundamental
to
our
6


democracy;
and
7


WHEREAS,
the
First
Amendment
of
the
Constitution
8


of
the
United
States
was
designed
to
protect
the
free
9


speech
rights
of
people
regardless
of
wealth,
and
not
10


corporations;
and
11


WHEREAS,
corporations
are
not
people
who
are
12


entitled
to
constitutional
rights
of
citizenship
but
13


instead
are
entities
created
by
the
laws
of
states
and
14


nations;
and
15


WHEREAS,
the
Supreme
Court’s
ruling
in
Citizens
16


United
v.
Federal
Election
Commission
overturned
17


long-standing
precedent
prohibiting
corporations
18


from
spending
their
general
treasury
funds
in
our
19


elections;
and
20


WHEREAS,
the
opinion
of
the
four
dissenting
justices
21


in
Citizens
United
v.
Federal
Election
Commission
22


noted
that
corporations
have
special
advantages
not
23


enjoyed
by
natural
persons,
such
as
limited
liability,
24


perpetual
life,
and
favorable
treatment
of
the
25


accumulation
and
distribution
of
assets,
that
allow
26


them
to
spend
prodigious
sums
on
campaign
messages
that
27


have
little
or
no
correlation
with
the
beliefs
held
by

natural
persons;
and
1


WHEREAS,
the
majority
opinion
of
the
Supreme
Court
2


in
Austin
v.
Michigan
Chamber
of
Commerce,
494
U.S.
3


652
(1990),
ruled
that
the
people
have
a
compelling
4


interest
in
preventing
the
corrosive
and
distorting
5


effects
of
immense
aggregations
of
wealth
that
are
6


accumulated
with
the
help
of
the
corporate
form
and
7


that
have
little
or
no
correlation
to
the
public’s
8


support
for
the
corporation’s
political
ideas
from
9


unduly
influencing
our
political
process;
and
10


WHEREAS,
the
general
public
and
political
leaders
in
11


the
United
States
have
recognized,
since
the
founding
12


of
our
country,
that
the
interests
of
corporations
13


do
not
always
correspond
with
the
public
interest
14


and
that,
therefore,
the
political
influence
of
15


corporations
should
be
limited;
and
16


WHEREAS,
notwithstanding
the
decision
in
Citizens
17


United
v.
Federal
Election
Commission,
legislators
have
18


a
duty
to
protect
democracy
and
our
Constitution
and
19


defend
them
from
the
potentially
detrimental
effects
20


of
corporate
spending
in
local,
state,
and
federal
21


elections;
NOW
THEREFORE,
22


BE
IT
RESOLVED
BY
THE
SENATE,
That
the
Senate
23


urges
the
United
States
Congress
to
enact
appropriate
24


legislation
to
regulate
and
restrict
corporate
25


participation
in
election
campaigns;
and
26


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
the
Secretary
of
the
27


Senate
is
directed
to
forward
a
copy
of
this
resolution
28


to
each
member
of
the
Iowa
Congressional
delegation.
