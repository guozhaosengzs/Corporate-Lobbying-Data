a.
Technology

of
18


health
and
medical
care
in
Iowa
and
across
the
nation.
19

The

provides
1


that
it
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
establish
2


a
statewide
Iowa
health
information
network,
which
is
not
3


to
constitute
a
health
benefit
network
or
health

network;
and
is
not
to
preclude
the
formation
and
operation
5


of
regional,
population-specific,
or
local
health
information
6


networks
or
their
participation
in
the

The

by
participants
who
access
and
use
the
network.
The
fee
14

structured
using
fair
share
and
value-based
15


principles.
The
department
is
directed

The
bill
specifies
the
duties
of
the
department
in
the
19


day-to-day
operations
of
the
Iowa
health
information
network.
20


The
bill
provides
for
the
creation
of
a
separate
Iowa
21


health
information
network
fund
within
the
state
treasury
22


under
the
control
of
the
board.
All
revenues,

and
other
moneys
received
or

board
approval.
28


Moneys
in
the
fund
at
the
end

each
fiscal
year
remain
in
the

audits
30


by
the
auditor
of
