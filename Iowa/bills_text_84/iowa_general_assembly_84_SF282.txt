before
January

15


The
division
strikes
Code
section
422.7,
subsection
29A,
16


which
provided
an
exclusion
from
income
of
the
value
of
health
17


care
coverage
of
a
nonqualified
tax
dependent
up
to
the
age
18


of
25.
The
federal
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
Care
19


Act,
Pub.
L.
No.
111-148,
provides
for
the
exclusion
from
20


income
of
the
value
of
health
care
coverage
of
a
nonqualified
21


tax
dependent
up
to
the
age
of
27,
effective
March
30,
2010.
22


Because
the
bill
now
couples
Iowa
with
the
Internal
Revenue
23


Code
with
regard
to
this
provision,
Code
section
422.7,
24


subsection
29A,
is
no
longer
necessary
for
tax
years
beginning
25


on
or
after
January
1,
2011.
This
change
applies
retroactively
26


to
that
date.
27


Currently,
in
certain
circumstances,
Code
section
28


422.9(2)(i)
provides
individuals
a
deduction
from
net
income
29


(also
known
as
a
“below-the-line”
deduction)
for
state
sales
30


and
use
taxes
in
lieu
of
a
deduction
for
income
taxes.
This
31


deduction
was
only
available
for
taxable
years
beginning
32


after
December
31,
2003,
and
before
January
1,
2006.
The
33


division
extends
this
deduction
to
tax
years
beginning
after
34


December
31,
2003,
and
before
January
1,
2008,

1


Division
II
of
the
bill
amends
certain
Code
sections
2


relating
to
the
state
research
activities
tax
credit
for
3


individuals,
corporations,
corporations
in
economic
development
4


areas,
and
corporations
in
quality
jobs
enterprise
zones.
The
5


division
updates
Iowa
Code
references
to
the
Internal
Revenue
6


Code
for
purposes
of
coupling
with
changes
to
the
federal
7


research
activities
tax
credit.
8


The
division
also
makes
certain
changes
relating
to
the
9


alternative
incremental
research
tax
credit.
Because
this
10


tax
credit
was
repealed
for
federal
tax
purposes,
the
bill
11


removes
references
to
it
from
the
Iowa
Code
and
replaces
them
12


with
an
alternative
simplified
research
tax
credit
for
Iowa
13


tax
purposes
based
upon
the
new
federal
alternative
simplified
14


credit.
The
amendments
to
Code
section
15.335,
subsection
15


4,
and
Code
section
15A.9
relate
to
this
change
and
apply
16


retroactively
to
July
1,
2010,
for
tax
credits
awarded
on
or
17


after
that
date.
18


The
division
also
makes
certain
changes
in
the
calculation
19


of
the
additional
research
activities
credit
that
depend
on
20


whether
an
eligible
business
has
$20
million
or
more
in
gross
21


revenues.
These
changes
only
apply
to
tax
years
beginning
22


on
or
after
January
1,
2010,
and
do
not
include
tax
years
23


beginning
after
December
31,
2008,
and
before
January
1,
2010.
24


Both
divisions
of
the
bill
take
effect
upon
enactment.
