EXPLANATION

GENERAL.
This
bill
amends
provisions
in
a
number
of
Code
10


chapters
relating
to
motor
fuel
sold
in
this
state,
including
11


motor
fuel
that
contains
a
percentage
of
a
biofuel
(biodiesel
12


or
ethanol).
13


REGULATION
OF
MOTOR
FUEL.
The
bill
amends
several
14


provisions
in
Code
chapter
214A,
which
regulates
the
sale
15


of
motor
fuel
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
16


stewardship
(DALS).
The
bill
establishes
a
standard
for
17


biodiesel
blended
fuel
based
on
A.S.T.M.
international
18


specifications.
It
also
rewrites
a
provision
that
requires
19


that
a
motor
fuel
pump
be
affixed
with
a
decal
(label)
20


informing
the
traveling
public
whether
it
is
dispensing
a
motor
21


fuel
containing
ethanol
or
biodiesel.
It
retains
the
label
22


requirement
for
a
motor
fuel
pump
dispensing
E-85
gasoline
23


for
flexible
fuel
vehicles
or
biodiesel
blended
fuel
for
24


diesel-powered
motor
vehicles,
removes
a
provision
requiring
a
25


label
for
a
motor
fuel
pump
dispensing
other
types
of
ethanol
26


blended
fuel
(standard
ethanol
blended
gasoline),
and
requires
27


a
label
for
a
motor
fuel
pump
dispensing
gasoline
without
an
28


ethanol
component
(nonblended
gasoline).
29


EXCISE
TAXES
IMPOSED
UPON
BIODIESEL
FUEL.
The
bill
amends
30


provisions
in
Code
chapter
452A,
which
relate
to
an
excise
31


tax
imposed
upon
biodiesel
fuel.
Generally,
an
excise
tax
is
32


imposed
on
each
gallon
of
motor
fuel,
including
biodiesel
fuel
33


(Code
section
452A.3)
based
on
a
gross
volume
basis
without
34


adjustment
(Code
section
452A.86).

change
the
excise
tax
imposed
on
biodiesel
fuel,
but
changes
1


how
the
gallonage
is
calculated
at
the
meter,
by
requiring
that
2


the
excise
tax
be
assessed
after
adjusting
the
biodiesel’s
3


temperature
to
60
degrees
Fahrenheit.
4


The
bill
also
provides
for
a
refund
of
excise
taxes
paid
5


on
diesel
fuel
by
nonterminal
storage
facilities.
A
person
6


who
manufactures
a
biofuel,
including
ethanol
or
biodiesel
for
7


distribution,
is
classified
as
a
nonterminal
storage
facility
8


(Code
section
452A.2).
A
nonterminal
storage
facility
is
9


required
to
pay
an
excise
tax
on
diesel
fuel
used
in
producing
10


biodiesel
blended
fuel.
The
bill
provides
that
the
nonterminal
11


storage
facility
is
entitled
to
a
refund
of
the
excise
tax
paid
12


on
diesel
fuel
if
the
biodiesel
blended
fuel
is
distributed
13


to
a
licensed
blender
(Code
section
452A.6)
who
must
pay
the
14


excise
tax
on
that
same
diesel
fuel.

establishes
a
17


tax
credit
for
the
promotion
of
ethanol
blended
gasoline
(Code
18


sections
422.11N

and
biodiesel
blended
motor

20


(Code
sections
422.11P
and
422.33(11C)).
The
bill
provides
21


that
in
order
for
a
retail
dealer
to
claim
a
tax
credit,
it
must
22


comply
with
an
existing

(Code

24


for
its

26


ethanol

ethanol
blended
gasoline
gallonage,
E-85
