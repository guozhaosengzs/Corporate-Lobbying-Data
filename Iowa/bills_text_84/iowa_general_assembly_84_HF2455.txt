year
examination


conducted
pursuant
to
subsection
1
during
a
fiscal
year.
Such


fees
are
due
on

each
year.
The
auditor
of
state


shall
base
the
fees
on
a
sliding
scale,
based
on
the
city’s


budgeted
gross
expenditures,
to
produce
total
revenue
of
not


more
than
three
hundred
seventy-five
thousand

subsection

hundred
seventy-five
thousand
dollars,

auditor
of
state


shall

the
excess
funds
to
provide
training
to
city


officials
on
municipal
financial
management
or
shall
contract


with
a
qualified
organization
to
provide
such
training.


Notwithstanding
section
8.33,
any
fees
collected
by
the
auditor


of
state
for
these
purposes
that
remain
unexpended
at
the
end


of
the
fiscal
year
shall
not
revert
to
the
general
fund
of
the


state
or
any
other
fund
but
shall
remain
available
for
use
for


the
following
fiscal
year
for
the
purposes
authorized
in
this


subsection.

The
