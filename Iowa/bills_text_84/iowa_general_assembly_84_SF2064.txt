EXPLANATION
22


This
bill
concerns
eligibility
requirements
for
retirement
23


incentive
programs
that
a
school
district
board
of
directors
24


may
adopt
for
its
employees.
Current
law
provides
that
any
25


retirement
incentive
program
shall
be
limited
to
encouraging
26


employees
to
retire
before
their
normal
retirement
date
under

the
Iowa
public

retirement
system
(IPERS)
and
that
28


the
board
may
include
the
costs
of
any
retirement
incentive

program
adopted
in
the
district
management
levy
only
for
those
30


employees
from
age
55
to
65
who
retire.
The
bill
eliminates
31


these
specific
age
and
service
requirements
relative
to
the
32


retirement
incentive
program
adopted
by
a
school
board.
The

bill

board
