to
the
need
to
promote
uniformity
of
the
law
4


with
respect
to
its
subject
matter
among
states
that
enact
the

EXPLANATION

The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
9


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
10


The
first
session
of
the
88th
general
assembly
enacted
11


SF
569,
the
uniform
protected
series
Act
(2019
Iowa
Acts,
12


chapter
26).
The
Act
amended
Code
chapter
489,
the
revised
13


uniform
limited
liability
company
Act
(RULLCA)
as
approved
14


and
recommended
by
the
national
conference
on
commissioners
15


of
uniform
state
laws
(Code
chapter
5).
Generally,
the
16


Act
provides
that
a
protected
series
operating
under
the
17


organizational
structure
of
a
series
limited
liability
company
18


may
function
in
a
manner
analogous
to
a
separate
legal
entity.
19


The
uniform
protected
series
Act
will
be
codified
as
Article
14
20


of
Code
chapter
489
and
by
July
1,
2021,
will
replace
Article
21


12
relating
to
the
same
subject
matter.
This
bill’s
provision
22


closely
resembles
Code
section
489.1304,
which
applies
to
the
23


entire
Code
chapter.
