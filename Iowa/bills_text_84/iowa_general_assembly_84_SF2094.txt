Section
1.
Section
537.7103,
subsection
3,
paragraph
a,
1


subparagraph
(8),
Code
2011,
is
amended
to
read
as
follows:
2


(8)
Communicating
with
the
debtor’s
spouse
with
the
consent


3


of
the
debtor,
or
responding
to
inquiry
from
the
debtor’s
4


spouse.
5


EXPLANATION
6


This
bill
relates
to
the
disclosure
of
information
relating
7


to
a
debt
to
the
spouse
of
the
debtor.
8


The
consumer
credit
code
contained
in
Code
chapter
537
9


specifies
prohibited
practices
in
connection
with
the
10


dissemination
of
information
relating
to
a
debt
or
a
debtor.
11


One
of
the
prohibited
practices
concerns
communicating
or
12


threatening
to
communicate
or
implying
that
a
debt
exists
to
a
13


person
other
than
the
debtor
or
a
person
who
might
reasonably
14


be
expected
to
be
liable
for
the
debt,
except
with
the
written
15


permission
of
the
debtor
given
after
default.
There
are
16


several
exceptions
to
this
prohibition,
however,
including
17


communications
with
the
debtor’s
spouse
with
the
consent
of
the
18


debtor,
or
responding
to
an
inquiry
from
the
debtor’s
spouse.
19


This
spousal
exception
does
not
currently
authorize
or
extend
20


to
communicating
with
the
debtor’s
spouse
without
the
consent
21


of
the
debtor
where
the
communication
is
not
pursuant
to
an
22


inquiry
from
the
debtor’s
spouse.
23


This
bill
removes
the
provision
that
the
communication
with
24


the
debtor’s
spouse
is
authorized
only
with
the
consent
of
the
25


debtor
in
a
nonspousal
inquiry
situation.
Accordingly,
a
debt
26


collector
would
be
permitted
to
disclose
information
relating
27


to
a
debt
to
the
spouse
of
the
debtor
without
the
requirement
28


that
the
debtor
consent
to
the
communication.
