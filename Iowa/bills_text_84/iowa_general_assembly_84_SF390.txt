NEW
PARAGRAPH


.
d.
A
rate-regulated
electric
utility
that

was
subject
to
a
revenue
sharing
settlement
agreement
with

regard
to
its
electric
base
rates
as
of
January

11


476.53
Electric
generating
and
transmission
facilities.
12


1.
It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
attract
13


the
development
of
electric
power
generating
and
transmission
14


facilities
within
the
state
in
sufficient
quantity
to
ensure
15


reliable
electric
service
to
Iowa
consumers
and
provide
16


economic
benefits
to
the
state.
It
is
also
the
intent
of
the
17


general
assembly
to
encourage
rate-regulated
public
utilities
18


to
consider
altering
existing
electric
generating
facilities,
19


where
reasonable,
to
manage
carbon
emission
intensity
in
20


order
to
facilitate
the
transition
to
a
carbon-constrained
21


environment.
22


2.


a.
The
general
assembly’s
intent
with
regard
to
the
23


development
of
electric
power
generating
and
transmission
24


facilities,
or
the
significant
alteration
of
an
existing
25


generating
facility,
as
provided
in
this


subsection
1
,
shall
be
26


implemented
in
a
manner
that
is
cost-effective
and
compatible
27


with
the
environmental
policies
of
the
state,
as
expressed
in
28


Title
XI
.
29


b.
The
general
assembly’s
intent
with
regard
to
the
30


reliability
of
electric
service
to
Iowa
consumers,
as
provided
31


in
this


subsection
1
,
shall
be
implemented
by
considering
the
32


diversity
of
the
types
of
fuel
used
to
generate
electricity,
33


the
availability
and
reliability
of
fuel
supplies,
and
the
34


impact
of
the
volatility
of
fuel
costs.

2.
It
is
also
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
1


encourage
the
prudent
development
of
baseload
nuclear


2


electric
power
generation.
Nuclear
generation
has
a
long-term
3


proven
record
of
providing
a
safe,
reliable,
and
secure
4


source
of
electricity
in
the
United
States
and
offers
the
5


potential
for
significant
job
creation,
substantial
economic


6


development
benefits,
and
the
production
of
electricity
at


7


significantly
reduced
levels
of
regulated
air
emissions
when
8


compared
to
output
from
other
thermal
generation
sources.
9


Further,
the
general
assembly
recognizes
that
meeting
10


stringent
environmental
permit
requirements
is
expensive
and
11


creates
significant
cost
burdens
on
customers
and
employers
12


attributable
to
the
imposition
of
additional
comprehensive
13


and
costly
regulations
by
the
United
States
environmental
14


protection
agency
that
dramatically
increase
costs
to
15


customers.
Finally,
the
general
assembly
recognizes
that
16


development
of
nuclear
electric
power
generation
requires


17


significant
capital
investment
and
a
substantial
period
of
18


time
for
successful
nuclear
generation
development,
siting,
19


licensing,
and
deployment.

The
board
shall
specify
in

by
order
issued
21


after
a

proceeding,
the
ratemaking
principles
22


that
will
apply
when
the
costs
of

has
demonstrated
to
the
board
that
the
public
13


utility
has
considered
other
sources
for
long-term
electric
14


supply
and
that
the
facility
or
lease
is
reasonable
when
15


compared
to
other
feasible
alternative
sources
of
supply.
The
16


rate-regulated
public
utility
may
satisfy
the
requirements
of


17


this
subparagraph
through
a
competitive
bidding
process,
under
18


rules
adopted
by
the
board,
that
demonstrate
the
facility
or
19


lease
is
a
reasonable
alternative
to
meet
its
electric
supply
20


needs.


21


d.
The
applicable
ratemaking
principles
shall
be
determined
22


in

EXPLANATION
19


This
bill
relates
to
the
permitting,
licensing,
20


construction,
and
operation
of
nuclear
generation
facilities.
21


The
bill
provides
that
it
is
the
intent
of
the
general
22


assembly
to
encourage
the
prudent
development
of
baseload
23


nuclear
electric
power
generation,
noting
that
nuclear
24


generation
has
a
long-term
proven
record
of
providing
a
safe,
25


reliable,
and
secure
source
of
electricity,
and
offers
the
26


potential
for
significant
job
creation,
substantial
economic
27


development
benefits,
and
the
production
of
electricity
at
28


significantly
reduced
levels
of
regulated
air
emissions
when
29


compared
to
output
from
other
thermal
generation
sources.
30


The
bill
provides
that
the
general
assembly
also
recognizes
31


that
meeting
stringent
environmental
permit
requirements
is
32


expensive
and
creates
significant
cost
burdens
on
customers
33


and
employers
attributable
to
the
imposition
of
additional
34


comprehensive
and
costly
regulations
by
the
United
States

environmental
protection
agency
that
dramatically
increase
1


costs
to
customers.
The
bill
provides
that
the
general
2


assembly
additionally
recognizes
that
development
of
nuclear
3


electric
power
generation
requires
significant
capital
4


investment
and
a
substantial
period
of
time
for
successful
5


nuclear
generation
development,
siting,
licensing,
and
6


deployment.
7


The
bill
requires
a
rate-regulated
electric
utility
that
8


was
subject
to
a
revenue
sharing
settlement
agreement
with
9


regard
to
its
electric
base
rates
as
of
January
1,
2010,
to
10


file
an
application
for
ratemaking
principles
applicable
to
the
11


construction
of
a
nuclear
generating
facility
with
the
Iowa
12


utilities
board,
and
that
the
application
shall
comply
with
the
13


provisions
of
Code
section
476.53.
14


The
bill
makes
significant
modifications
to
Code
section
15


476.53
consistent
with
the
potential
construction
of
a
nuclear
16


generating
facility.
The
bill
provides
that
the
board
shall
17


specify
in
advance
the
ratemaking
principles
that
will
apply
18


when
a
rate-regulated
public
utility
expresses
its
intent
to
19


file
an
application
pursuant
to
Code
section
476A.3
to
build
a
20


nuclear
generating
facility,
including
but
not
limited
to
small
21


modular
reactor
technology,
or
expresses
its
intent
to
seek
22


authority
pursuant
to
a
combined
construction
and
operating
23


license
or
an
early
site
permit
from
the
United
States
nuclear
24


regulatory
commission,
or
leases
or
owns
in
whole
or
in
part
25


such
a
facility.
26


The
bill
provides
that
in
determining
the
applicable
27


ratemaking
principles
for
a
nuclear
generating
facility
or
for
28


a
license
or
permit
from
the
United
States
nuclear
regulatory
29


commission,
a
ratemaking
principles
order
issued
by
the
30


board
shall
incorporate
several
components.
The
bill
states
31


that
after
the
order
is
issued,
the
utility
may
recover
from
32


utility
customers
a
return
on,
and
return
of
all
prudent
costs
33


associated
with,
the
permitting,
licensing,
and
construction
of
34


a
facility,
reduced
by
the
amount
of
any

governmental
entity,
and
costs
recovered
from
any
joint
owners
2


of
the
nuclear
generating
facility.
The
bill
provides
that
3


the
determination
of
prudent
costs
and
the
level
and
rate
of
4


the
recovery
of
charges
shall
be
reset
annually
to
reflect
the
5


level
of
reasonable
costs
related
to
pursuit
of
United

6


nuclear
regulatory
commission
authority
or
construction
costs
7


expected
to
be
incurred
by
the
utility
in
the
next
12
months.
8


A
determination
shall
also
be
made
of
any
adjustment
required
9


to
balance
the
preceding
period’s
actual
expenditures
and
10


financing
costs
with
what
had
been
projected
and
included
in
11


costs
recoverable
for
the
preceding
period.
The
bill
directs
12


a
utility,
if
applicable,
to
report
to
the
board
annually
the
13


budgeted
and
actual
costs
as
compared
to
the
estimated
total
14


in-service
cost
of
the
nuclear
generating
facility
that
was
15


presented
in
the
last
annual
filing,
as
projected
through
the
16


expected
in-service
date
of
the
nuclear
generating
facility.
17


The
bill
provides
that
after
the
order
is
issued,
a
utility
18


shall
file
an
application
with
the
board
on
an
annual
basis
19


providing
the
budgeted
versus
actual
cost
information,
and
that
20


each
annual
proceeding
shall
be
completed
by
the
board
within
21


90
days
from
the
date
of
filing
the
application.
22


The
bill
states
that
all
United
States
nuclear
regulatory
23


commission
authority
costs
are
to
be
recovered

a
nuclear
25


generating
facility
as
determined
by
the
board,
and
that
all
26


nuclear
generating
facility
construction
costs
are
to
be
27

plus
its
useful
life
as
29


determined
by
the
board.
The
bill
also
states
that
a
utility’s

to
which
the
investor’s
14


capital
is
exposed
and
not
the
investor’s
source
of
funds,
and
15


the

The
bill
exempts
a
rate-regulated
public
utility
applying
1


for
ratemaking
principles
with
regard
to
a
nuclear
generating
2


facility
from
requirements
that
a
utility
must
demonstrate
to
3


the
board
that
it
has
considered
other
sources
for
long-term
4


electric
supply
and
that
the
facility
or
a
lease
of
a
facility
5


is
reasonable
when
compared
to
other
feasible
alternative
6


sources
of
supply,
and
removes
a
provision
applicable
with
7


regard
to
any
application
that
a
utility
may
satisfy
these
8


requirements.
9


The
bill
provides
that
any
judicial
action
directly
10


or
indirectly
resulting
in
a
modification
of
the
board’s
11


ratemaking
principles
order
shall
be
applied
prospectively
12


only,
and
that
no

shall
be
made
of
revenues
previously
13


collected,
unless
the
board
determines
such
revenues
to
be
in
14


excess
of
the
costs
incurred
or
to
be
incurred
by
the
utility.
15


The
bill
directs
the
board
to
conduct
a
study
to
identify
16


the
potential
impact
to
customer
electric
utility
rates
17


resulting
from
recent
federal
regulations
adopted
by
the
United
18


States
environmental
protection
agency,
and
strategies
to
19


mitigate
this
impact.
The
study
shall
be
undertaken
with
the
20


involvement
of
rate-regulated
electric
public
utilities
and
21


other
stakeholders
identified
by
the
board.
The

the
board
to
submit
a
report
regarding
the
results
of
the
study
23


by
January
1,
