This
bill
creates
two
distinct
analysis

administrative

by
health-related
licensing

boards.
25


The
scope
of
practice
impact
statement
requires
that
a
26


health-related
licensing
board
analyze
the
impact
of
a
rule
27


upon
the
duties
and
functions
of
a
licensed
health
profession
28


directly
impacted
by
the
rule
and
the
duties
and
functions
29


of
health
professionals
whose
jobs
are
indirectly
impacted
30


by
a
proposed
rule.
The
statement
may
be
requested
by
the
31


administrative
rules
review
committee
or
the
governor’s
32


administrative
rules
coordinator.
33


The
second
analysis
requires
a
cost-benefit
analysis
on
34


specific
subjects
relating
to
regulation.
A
proposed
rule

analysis
must
be

within
70
days
of
the
request.
The
regulatory
analysis
must

of
the
data
to
the
extent
practicable
4


and
must
take
account
of
both
short-term
and
long-term
5


consequences.
The

for
this
analysis
may
be
made
by
6


the
administrative
rules
review

administrative
7


rules
