EXPLANATION
22


This
bill
requires
that
all
voters
show
proof
of
23


identification,
as
defined
in
the
bill,
before
being
allowed
24


to
vote
at
the
polls
or
to
vote
an
absentee
ballot
in
person
25


at
the
commissioner’s
office
or
at
a
satellite
absentee
voting
26


station.
27


The
bill
allows
a
voter
to
cast
a
provisional
ballot
in
28


certain
circumstances
where
the
voter
is
unable
to
provide
or
29


refuses
to
provide
the
required
proof
of
identification.
If
30


a
voter
casts
a
provisional
ballot
for
this
reason,
the
voter
31


has
until
the
Monday
following
the
election
to
appear
at
the
32


commissioner’s
office
to
present
proof
of
identification
or
to
33


execute
an
affidavit.
34


The
bill
amends
Code
section
48A.7A,

day
and
in-person
absentee
voter
registration,
to
require
that
1


the
forms
of
identification
necessary
to
register
in
this
2


manner
are
the
same
forms
of
proof
of
identification
necessary
3


to
vote.
The
bill
retains
the
current
requirement
that
if
the
4


proof
of
identification
offered
for
election
day
and
in-person
5


absentee
registration
does
not
contain
a
current
address,
the
6


registrant
must
provide
proof
of
residency.
7


Code
section
48A.7A
is
also
amended
to
strike
the
provision
8


allowing
another
registered
voter
to
sign
an
oath
affirming
a
9


registrant’s
identity
and
residency.
10


The
bill
makes
corresponding
amendments
regarding
11


identification
requirements
for
certain
persons
who
register
to
12


vote
by
mail
and
for
registered
voters
who
do
not
respond
to
a
13


confirmation
card
sent
by
the
county
commissioner
of
elections.
14


The
bill
amends
Code
section
144.46,
relating
to
obtaining
15


a
certified
copy
of
a
birth
certificate,
to
provide
that
the
16


fee
for
the
document
shall
not
be
charged
to
a
person
who
17


executes
an
affidavit
indicating
the
applicant
is
obtaining
18


the
birth
certificate
in
order
to
obtain
an
Iowa
nonoperator’s
19


identification
card
for
the
purposes
of
voting.
The
bill
also
20


amends
Code
section
321.190
to
provide
that
a
person
obtaining
21


an
Iowa
nonoperator’s
identification
card
for
the
purposes
of
22


voting
is
not
required
to
pay
an
issuance
fee
for
the
card.
23


The
bill
takes
effect
January
1,
2012,
and
applies
to
24


elections
held
on
or
after
that
date.
