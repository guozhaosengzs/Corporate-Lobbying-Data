EXPLANATION
1


A
“501(c)”
is
a
tax-exempt,
nonprofit
corporation
or
2


association.
The
term
is
a
reference
to
the
United
States
3


Internal
Revenue
Code.
A
501(c)(4)
organization
includes
a
4


nonprofit
civic
league
or
organization
operated
exclusively
5


for
the
promotion
of
social
welfare.
A
501(c)(6)
organization
6


includes
a
business
league,
chamber
of
commerce,
or
7


similar
group
not
organized
for
profit.
This
bill
amends
8


the
definition
of
“political
committee”
to
include
these
9


organizations.
10


The
bill
also
requires
organizations
qualifying
as
exempt
11


from
taxation
under
§
501(c)(4)
or
§
501(c)(6)
of
the

12


Revenue
Code

ethics
and
campaign
13


finance
disclosure
board
if
they
participate
in
Iowa
campaigns,
14


engage
in
issue
advocacy,
or
expect
to
receive
$25,000
or
more
15


in
gross
receipts
in
a
year.
16


The
report
for
a
§
501(c)(4)
or
§
501(c)(6)
organization
must
17


contain
the
same
information
as
a
report
prepared
pursuant
to
18


26
U.S.C.
§
527,
relating
to
political
organizations.
19


As
provided
in
Code
section
68A.701,
a
willful
violation
of
20


any
provision
of
the
campaign
finance
Code
chapter
is
a
serious
21


misdemeanor
punishable
by
confinement
for
up
to
one
year
and
22


a

of
at
least
