EXPLANATION
15


This
bill
increases
the
sales
and
use
taxes
and
uses
the
16


increased
revenues
to
fund
the
natural
resources
and
outdoor
17


recreation
trust
fund
and
to
provide
a
commercial
property
tax
18


credit.
19


Currently,
the
sales
and
use
taxes
are
imposed
at
the
rate
20


of
6
percent.
Division
I
of
the
bill
amends
the
several
21


provisions
imposing
these
taxes
by
increasing
the
rate
to
7
22


percent.
23


In
November
2010,
Iowa
voters
ratified
an
amendment
to
the
24


Iowa
Constitution.
The
amendment
creates
a
natural
resources
25


and
outdoor
recreation
trust
fund
in
the
state
treasury
for
26


purposes
of
funding
certain
environmental
and
natural
resource
27


programs
and
diverts
an
amount
equal
to
a
sales
tax
rate
28


of
three-eighths
of
1
percent
into
the
fund.
Moneys
are
29


not
credited
to
the
fund
until
the
state
sales
tax
rate
is
30


increased.
The
amendment
also
directs
the
general
assembly
to
31


provide
for
the
implementation
of
the
fund.
32


Since
division
I
increases
the
state
sales
tax
rate,
the
33


division
provides
for
the
required
transfer
of
moneys
into
34


the
fund.
However,
the
division
increases
the
sales
tax
rate

by
more
than
the
amount
required
to
be
transferred,
so
the
1


division
also
provides
for
the
transfer
of
the
balance
of
the
2


revenues
plus
the
moneys
from
the
increased
use
tax
into
a
3


commercial
property
tax
relief
fund.
4


Division
II
of
the
bill
creates
the
commercial
property
tax
5


relief
fund
and
provides
a
tax
credit
for
commercial
property
6


taxpayers.
7


The
property
tax
relief
fund
is
created
in
the
state
treasury
8


consisting
of
the
moneys
from
the
increased
sales
and
use
taxes
9


not
transferred
to
the
natural
resources
and
outdoor
recreation
10


trust
fund.
Moneys
in
the
fund
are
appropriated
to
the
11


department
of
revenue
for
purposes
of
providing
a
commercial
12


property
tax
credit.
Interest
and
earnings
on
moneys
in
the
13


fund
are
credited
to
the
fund,
and
moneys
in
the
fund
do
not
14


revert
to
the
general
fund
of
the
state.
15


The
division
provides
that
all
commercial
property
taxpayers
16


are
eligible
for
a
tax
credit
in
an
amount
not
to
exceed
their
17


annual
property
tax
liability
and
requires
each
taxpayer
18


to
file
a
claim
for
credit
annually
by
March
1
immediately
19


preceding
the
fiscal
year
during
which
the
property
taxes
are
20


due.
21


The
division
provides
that
on
or
before
April
1
of
each
22


year,
the
county
auditors
must
provide
to
the
department
of
23


revenue
a
report
of
the
total
amount
of
taxes
levied
or
to
be
24


levied
on
the
taxpayers
eligible
for
a
credit.
The
department
25


determines
whether
there
are
sufficient
moneys
in
the
fund
to
26


cover
the
combined
tax
liability
of
all
the
eligible
taxpayers
27


and
apportions
the
moneys
accordingly.
If
the
moneys
in
the
28


fund
are
sufficient,
each
eligible
business
receives
an
amount
29


equal
to
its
tax
liability.
If
the
moneys
in
the
fund
are
not
30


sufficient,
each
eligible
taxpayer
receives
a
pro
rata
share
of
31


the
moneys
in
the
fund.
32


The
division
directs
the
director
of
revenue
to
authorize
33


the
department
of
administrative
services
to
issue
warrants
34


on
the
fund
payable
to
the
county
treasurers
in
the
amount

in

county
are
entitled.
The
county
auditor
determines
the
amount
2


to
be
credited
to
each
eligible
taxpayer.
The
county
treasurer
3


must
show
on
the
tax
statement
the

of
tax
credit
for
the

eligible
taxpayer.

II
of
the
bill

taxes
due
and

payable
in
fiscal
years
beginning
on
or
after
