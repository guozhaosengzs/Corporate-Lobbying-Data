EXPLANATION
15


This
joint
resolution
proposes
an
amendment
to
the
16


Constitution
of
the
State
of
Iowa
relating
to
state
budgets.
17


The
amendment
provides
for
a
general
state
revenue
18


expenditure
limitation.
The
amount
of
the
limitation
is
99
19


percent
of
the
adjusted
revenue
estimate.
The
amendment
20


defines
adjusted
revenue
estimate
and
requires
that
that
21


estimate
be
determined
by
a
revenue
estimating
conference
22


which
is
to
be
created
by
the
general
assembly
by
law.
The
23


amendment
requires
that
the
expenditure
limitation
be
used
by
24


the
governor
in
preparation
of
the
governor’s
budget
and
by
25


the
general
assembly
in
the
budget
process.
The
governor
is
26


prohibited
from
approving
or
disapproving
of
appropriations
27


in
a
manner
that
would
cause
the
final
budget
approved
by
the
28


governor
to
exceed
the
expenditure
limitation.
29


The
amendment
also
provides
that,
if
a
new
general
state
30


revenue
source
is
established
and
implemented,
95
percent
of
31


the
estimate
of
that
new
revenue
shall
be
included
in
the
32


expenditure
limitation.
33


The
amendment
also
requires
that
the
amount
of
any
surplus
34


which
exceeds
an
amount
equal
to
10
percent
of
the
adjusted
35

revenue
estimate
be
included
in
the
adjusted
revenue
estimate
1


for
the
following
fiscal
year.
Any
surplus
which
is
equal
2


to
10
percent
or
less
of
the
amount
of
the
adjusted
revenue
3


estimate
may
be
included
in
the
following
year’s
adjusted
4


revenue
estimate
if
inclusion
is
approved
in
a
bill
by
5


three-fifths
of
the
members
elected
to
each
house
of
the
6


general
assembly.
7


The
scope
of
the
expenditure
limitation
encompasses
8


any
portion
of
an
appropriation
previously
subject
to
an
9


expenditure
limitation
which
remains
authorized
for
expenditure
10


in
the
fiscal
year
to
which
the
expenditure
limitation
being
11


addressed
applies.
12


The
amendment
also
requires
the
state
to
use
generally
13


accepted
accounting
principles
for
state
budgeting
and
14


accounting
purposes.
The
amendment
provides
that
the
general
15


assembly
shall
enact
laws
to
implement
the
amendment.
16


The
resolution,
if
adopted,
will
be
referred
to
the
next
17


general
assembly.
If
the
next
general
assembly
adopts
the
18


resolution,
the
amendment
will
be
submitted
to
the
voters
for
19


ratification.
