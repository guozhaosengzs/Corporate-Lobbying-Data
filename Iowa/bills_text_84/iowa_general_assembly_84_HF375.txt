EXPLANATION

DIVISION
I
——
GENETICALLY
MODIFIED
AGRICULTURAL
SEEDS.
This
8


division
of
this
bill
amends
Code
chapter
199,
Iowa’s
seed
law,
9


which
generally
provides
for
labeling
requirements.
The
bill
10


amends
the
Code
chapter’s
definition
of
“agricultural
seed”
11


which
includes
grass,
forage,
cereal,
oil,
fiber,
and
any
other
12


kind
of
crop
seed,
lawn
seed,
vegetable
seed,
or
seed
mixture.
13


The
bill
provides
that
“agricultural
seed”
includes
any
such
14


seed
regardless
of
whether
it
has
been
genetically
modified
15


(changing
its
genetic
characteristics
in
a
manner
other
than
16


breeding
or
pollination).
17


The
bill
provides
that
a
person
required
to
label
a
18


container
of
agricultural
seed
cannot
sell
genetically
modified
19


agricultural
seed
in
a
container,
unless
the
person
segregates
20


the
per-container
costs
associated
with
making
the
genetic
21


modifications
and
the
per-container
costs
of
the
agricultural
22


seed
if
it
had
not
been
genetically
modified.
The
bill
23


provides
that
the
labeler
must
provide
the
segregated
costs
in
24


a
printed
format
or

——
GENETICALLY
MODIFIED
MILK
AND

31


This
division
of
the
bill
amends
Code
chapter
191
which
32


regulates
the
labeling
of
foods
in
Iowa,
including

is
administered
by

H.F.

The
bill
provides
that
milk
and
related
dairy
products
must
1


be
labeled
to
indicate
whether
the
originating
dairy
herd
2


producing
the
milk
was
administered
a
synthetic
bovine
growth
3


hormone
also
referred
to
as
recombinant
bovine
somatotropin
4


(rbST)
or
recombinant
bovine
growth
hormone
(rbGH).
The
bill
5


provides
labeling
requirements
for
the
retail
sale
of
milk
6


produced
in
this
state
or
a
dairy
product
manufactured
in
7


this
state
which
uses
milk
produced
in
this
state.
The
label
8


must
indicate
whether
the
milk
may
have
been,
was,
or
was
not
9


produced
from
a
herd
in
this
state
which
was
administered
with
10


a
synthetic
bovine
growth
hormone.
A
label
stating
that
milk
11


was
not
produced
from
a
herd
administered
with
a
synthetic
12


bovine
growth
hormone
must
be
verified
by
the
signed
affidavit
13


of
the
producer.
The
department
is
required
to
develop
label
14


requirements,
including
a
label
indicating
that
the
milk
or
15


dairy
product
is
“farmer-certified
rbGH
free”.
16


The
bill
provides
that
a
person
who
knowingly
sells
milk
or
17


a
dairy
product
in
violation
of
the
bill
is
subject
to
a
civil
18


penalty
of
not
more
than
$1,000
for
each
day
of
the
violation.
19


Currently,
the
department
may
bring
an
action
in
district
20


court
in
order
to
restrain
a
person
from
selling
milk
or
a
21


dairy
product
which
violates
state
labeling
laws
(Code
section
22


191.10).
The
bill
provides
the
same
right
to
an
individual
23


or
private
organization
or
association.
The
bill
includes
a
24


reciprocity
provision
with
other
states
that
have
provisions
25


similar
to
the
bill.
26


Division
II
takes
effect
on
January
1,
2012,
except
for
the
27


provision
authorizing
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
28


stewardship
to
adopt
rules,
which
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
