——
1


challenges
to
the
validity
of
a
statute
——
exclusive
jurisdiction
2


——
public
hearings
——
legislative
oversight.


1.
The
general
assembly
finds
and
declares
all
of
the
4


following:
5


a.
The
power
to
impeach
subsumes
reasonable
less
severe
6


remedies.
7


b.
The
intent
of
this
section
is
to
provide
for
a
mechanism
8


in
which
to
resolve
disputes
regarding
the
constitutionality
of
9


laws
between
the
courts
and
the
legislature,
both
of
which
are
10


composed
of
constitutional
scholars.
11


c.
Article
5,
section
4
of
the
Constitution
of
the
State
12


of
Iowa
states
that
the
supreme
court
is
“a
court
for
the
13


correction
of
errors
at
law,
under
such
restriction
as
the
14


general
assembly
may,
by
law,
prescribe
.
.
.”.
15


d.
Article
3,
section
20
of
the
Constitution
of
the
State
16


of
Iowa
gives
the
legislature
the
power
to
impeach
judges
for
17


“malfeasance
in
office”,
which
is
generally
defined
to
include
18


acting
without
authority
and
abusing
power.
The
power
to
19


impeach
subsumes
all
lesser
remedies.
20


e.
The
Constitution
of
the
State
of
Iowa
does
not
give
the
21


courts
of
this
state
the
power
to
invalidate
laws
enacted
by
22


the
legislature,
to
require
the
legislature
to
enact
different
23


laws,
or
to
publish
rulings
that
have
the
same
effect
as
new
24


legislation.
Article
3,
section
1
of
the
Constitution
of
25


the
State
of
Iowa
states:
“The
powers
of
the
government
of
26


Iowa
shall
be
divided
into
three
separate
departments
——
the
27


legislative,
the
executive,
and
the
judicial:
and
no
person
28


charged
with
the
exercise
of
powers
properly
belonging
to
one
29


of
these
departments
shall
exercise
any
function
appertaining
30


to
either
of
the
others,
except
in
cases
hereinafter
expressly
31


directed
or
permitted”.
32


f.
Although
the
courts
of
Iowa
have
usurped
those
powers
33


without
constitutional
authority,
it
has
been
done
for
reasons
34


which
the
general
assembly
respects.
The

assembly

S.F.
_____


welcomes
the
expertise
and
guidance
of
the
courts
in
evaluating
1


the
constitutionality
of
its
laws.
But
when
the
reasoning
of
2


rulings
which
function
as
legislation
appears
to
be
not
only
3


unsound,
but
unconstitutional,
the
general
assembly
has
the
4


constitutional
duty
and
authority
to
determine
that
judges
and
5


justices
have
abused
their
power
and
exceeded
their
authority,
6


which
are
grounds
for
impeachment
under
the
malfeasance
in
7


office
clause.
8


g.
A
remedy
short
of
impeachment
should
advance
wisdom,
9


build
consensus,
and
educate
voters
so
that
informed
voters
10


may
hold
both
judges
and
legislators
accountable.
Article
1,
11


section
2
of
the
Constitution
of
the
State
of
Iowa
states:
12


“All
political
power
is
inherent
in
the
people.
Government
is
13


instituted
for
the
protection,
security,
and
benefit
of
the
14


people,
and
they
have
the
right,
at
all
times,
to
alter
or
15


reform
the
same,
whenever
the
public
good
may
require
it”.
16


2.
The
supreme
court
shall
have
discretionary
and
exclusive
17


original
jurisdiction
over
any
challenge
to
any
law.
A
18


district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
shall
not
invalidate
a
19


law
on
any
grounds.
20


3.
A
decision
of
the
supreme
court
that
invalidates
21


existing
law
or
has
the
effect
of
creating
new
law
shall
not
22


have
any
effect
unless
agreed
to
by
five
or
more
of
the
seven
23


justices,
and
otherwise
shall
not
have
any
effect
for
one
24


year.
The
supreme
court
shall
also
have
the
power
to
suspend
25


implementation
of
a
new
law
provided
the
supreme
court
produces
26


an
expedited
ruling
within
three
months
of
the
law’s
enactment.

a
supreme
court
decision
28

published
that
invalidates
existing
law
or
has
the

29


of
creating

the
general
assembly
may,
by
resolution,
30


compel
the
attendance
of
specified
justices
to
a
public
hearing
31


to
discuss
and
debate
the
justification
for
the
decision
with
32


members
of
the
general
assembly.
A
public
record
of
the

and
