Funding

1.


Budget.
The
budget
of
an
approved
program
for
returning


dropouts
and
dropout
prevention
for
a
school
district,
after


subtracting
funds
received
from
other
sources
for
that

funded
annually
on
a
basis
of
one-fourth
or
more


from
the
district
cost
of
the
school
district
and
up
to


three-fourths
by
an
increase
in
allowable
growth
as
defined
in


section

.
Annually,
the
department
of
management
shall


establish
a
modified
allowable
growth
for
each
such
school


district
equal
to
the
difference
between
the
approved
budget


for
the
program
for
returning
dropouts
and
dropout
prevention


for
that
district
and
the
sum
of
the
amount
funded
from
the


district
cost
of
the
school
district
plus
funds
received
from


other
sources.


2.


Appropriate
uses
of
funding.
Appropriate
uses
of
the


returning
dropout

program
funding


include
but
are
not
limited
to
the
following:


a.

and
benefits
for

if
the
staff
person’s
time
is
dedicated
to
working
with


returning
dropouts
or
students
who
are
deemed,
at
any
time


during
the
school
year,
to
be
at
risk
of
dropping
out,
in


order
to
provide
services
beyond
those
which
are
provided
by


the
school
district
to
students
who
are
not
identified
as
at


risk
of
dropping
out.
However,
if
the
staff
person
works


part-time
with
students
who
are
participating
in
returning


dropout
and
dropout
prevention
programs,
alternative
programs,


and

another

assignment,
only
the
portion
of
the
staff
person’s
time
that


is
related
to
the
returning
dropout
and
dropout
prevention


program,
alternative
program,
or
alternative
school
may
be


charged
to
the
program.
For
purposes
of
this
paragraph,
if


an
alternative
setting
is
necessary
to
provide
for
a
program


which
is
offered
at
a
location
off
school
grounds
and
which


is
intended
to
serve
student
needs
by
improving
relationships


and
connections
to
school,
decreasing
truancy
and
tardiness,


providing
opportunities
for
course
credit
recovery,
or
helping


students
identified
as
at
risk
of
dropping
out
to
accelerate


through
multiple
grade
levels
of
achievement
within
a
shortened


time
frame,
the
tuition
costs
for
a
student
identified
as
at


risk
of
dropping
out
shall
be
considered
an
appropriate
use
of


the
returning
dropout
and
dropout
prevention
program
funding.


b.
Professional
development
for
all
teachers
and
staff


working
with
at-risk
students
and

involving
dropout


prevention
strategies.

all
of
the
following
criteria:

the
total
budgeted
amount
received


pursuant
to
subsection
1
may
be
used
for
purposes
of
providing


district-wide
or
building-wide
returning
dropout
and
dropout


prevention
programming
targeted
to
students
who
are
not
deemed


at
risk
