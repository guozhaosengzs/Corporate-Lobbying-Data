BY

A
Concurrent
Resolution
urging
the
United
States
1


Congress
to
modernize
the
Toxic
Substances
Control
2


Act
of
1976.
3


WHEREAS,
children
and
developing
fetuses
are
4


uniquely
vulnerable
to
the
health
threats
of
toxic
5


chemicals
and
early-life
chemical
exposures
have
been
6


linked
to
chronic
disease
later
in
life;
and
7


WHEREAS,
a
growing
body
of
peer-reviewed
scientific
8


evidence
links
exposure
to
toxic
chemicals
to
many
9


diseases
and
health
conditions
that
are
rising
in
10


incidence
including
childhood
cancers,
prostate
cancer,
11


breast
cancer,
learning
and
developmental
disabilities,
12


infertility,
and
obesity;
and
13


WHEREAS,
the
President’s
Cancer
Panel
report
14


released
in
May
2010
stated
“the
true
burden
of
15


environmentally
induced
cancers
has
been
grossly
16


underestimated”
and
advised
the
President
“to
use
17


the
power
of
your
office
to
remove
the
carcinogens
18


and
other
toxins
from
our
food,
water,
and
air
that
19


needlessly
increase
health
care
costs,
cripple
20


our
nation’s
productivity,
and
devastate
American
21


lives”;
and
22


WHEREAS,
workers
in
a
range
of
industries
are
23


exposed
to
toxic
chemicals
which
pose
threats
to
24


their
health,
increasing
worker
absenteeism,
workers’
25


compensation
claims,
and
health
care
costs
that
burden
26


the
economy;
and
27


WHEREAS,
a
recent
national
poll
found
that
78

5


percent
of
likely
American
voters
were
seriously
1


concerned
about
the
threat
to
children’s
health
from
2


exposure
to
toxic
chemicals
in
day-to-day
life;
and
3


WHEREAS,
states
bear
an
undue
burden
from
4


toxic
chemicals,
including
health
care
costs
and
5


environmental
damages,
disadvantaging
businesses
that
6


lack
information
on
chemicals
in
their
supply
chain
and
7


increasing
demands
for
state
regulation;
and
8


WHEREAS,
the
primary
governing
federal
statute,
9


the
Toxic
Substances
Control
Act
of
1976
(TSCA),
was
10


intended
to
authorize
the
United
States
Environmental
11


Protection
Agency
(EPA)
to
protect
public
health
and
12


the
environment
from
toxic
chemicals;
and
13


WHEREAS,
when
TSCA
was
passed
about
62,000
14


chemicals
in
commerce
were
grandfathered
in
without
any
15


required
testing
for
health
and
safety
hazards
or
any
16


restrictions
on
usage;
and
17


WHEREAS,
in
the
35
years
since
TSCA
passed,
the
EPA
18


has
required
chemical
companies
to
test
only
about
200
19


of
those
chemicals
for
health
hazards
and
has
issued
20


partial
restrictions
on
only
five
chemicals;
and
21


WHEREAS,
TSCA
has
been
widely
recognized
as
22


ineffective
and
obsolete
due
to
legal
and
procedural
23


hurdles
that
prevent
the
EPA
from
taking
quick
and
24


effective
regulatory
action
to
protect
the
public
25


against
well-known
chemical
threats;
and
26


WHEREAS,
in
January
2009,
the
United
States
General
27


Accounting
Office
added
the
EPA’s
regulatory
program
28


for
assessing
and
controlling
toxic
chemicals
to
its
29


list
of
high-risk
government
programs
that
are

S.C.R.

working
as
intended,
finding
that
the
EPA
has
been
1


unable
to
complete
assessments
even
of
chemicals
of
2


highest
concern;
that
the
EPA
requires
additional
3


authority
to
obtain
health
and
human
safety
information
4


from
the
chemical
industry
and
to
shift
more
of
the
5


burden
to
chemical
companies
to
demonstrate
the
safety
6


of
their
products;
and
that
the
TSCA
does
not
provide
7


sufficient
chemical
safety
data
for
public
use
by
8


consumers,
businesses,
and
workers,
and
fails
to
create
9


incentives
to
develop
safer
alternatives;
and
10


WHEREAS,
the
National
Conference
of
State
11


Legislatures
unanimously
adopted
a
resolution
in
July
12


2009
that
articulated
principles
for
TSCA
reform
and
13


called
on
Congress
to
act
to
update
the
law;
and
14


WHEREAS,
ten
states
have
come
together
to
launch
15


the
Interstate
Chemicals
Clearinghouse
to
coordinate
16


state
chemical
information
management
programs,
and
a
17


coalition
of
13
states
issued
guiding
principles
for
18


TSCA
reform;
and
19


WHEREAS,
71
state
laws
on
chemical
safety
have
been
20


enacted
and
signed
into
law
in
18
states
with
broad
21


bipartisan
support
over
the
last
eight
years;
and
22


WHEREAS,
state
policy
leadership
on
chemical
23


management,
although
outstanding,
cannot
substitute
for
24


Congressional
leadership
to
reform
TSCA,
a
reform
which
25


all
parties
agree
is
urgently
needed;
and
26


WHEREAS,
TSCA
is
the
only
major
federal
27


environmental
statute
that
has
never
been
updated
or
28


reauthorized;
and

BE
IT
RESOLVED
BY

THE

REPRESENTATIVES
CONCURRING,
That
the
Iowa
General
5

to
modernize
the

to
strengthen
7


chemicals
management
through
policy
reforms;
and
8


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
the
policy
reforms
9


should
require
chemical
manufacturers
to
prove
10


that
all
existing
and
new
chemicals
are
not
harmful
11


to
human
health,
and
provide
essential
health
and
12


safety
information
on
chemicals
to
inform
the
market,
13


consumers,
and
general
public;
and
14


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
the
policy
reforms
15


should
require
immediate
action
to
reduce
or
16


eliminate
the
worst
chemicals,
including
persistent,
17


bioaccumulative,
and
toxic
chemicals
and
other
18


priority
toxics
to
which
there
is
already
widespread
19


exposure;
and
20


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
the
policy
reforms
21


should
preserve
the
authority
of
state
and
tribal
22


governments
to
operate
chemicals
management
programs
23


that
are
more
protective
than
the
federal
programs;
and
24


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
the
policy
reforms
25


should
establish
health
safety
standards
for
chemicals
26


that
rely
on
the
best
available
science
to
protect
27


the
most
vulnerable
among
us,
such
as
children
and
28


developing
fetuses;
and

BE
IT
