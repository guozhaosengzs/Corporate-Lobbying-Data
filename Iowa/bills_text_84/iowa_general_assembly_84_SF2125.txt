Section
1.
LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
1


recognizes
the
importance
of
encouraging
individuals
to
discuss
2


and
make
health
care
decisions
before
a
situation
necessitates
3


an
actual
decision.
The
general
assembly
also
recognizes
4


that
health
care
planning
is
a
process,
rather
than
a
single
5


decision,
based
upon
the
individual’s
values
and
personal
6


health
status.
Advance
directives
provide
the
opportunity
for
7


an
individual
to
enunciate
and
document
the
individual’s
wishes
8


and
to
identify
the
person
authorized
to
make
decisions
for
the
9


individual
if
the
individual
is
unable
to
make
decisions.
The
10


general
assembly
recognizes
that
the
physician
order
for
scope
11


of
treatment
form,
modeled
after
the
national
physician
orders
12


for
life-sustaining
treatment
paradigm
initiative,
complements
13


advance
directives
by
converting
individual
wishes
contained
14


in
advance
directives,
or
as
otherwise
expressed,
into
medical
15


orders
that
may
be
recognized
and
acted
upon
across
medical
16


settings,
thereby
enhancing
the
ability
of
medical
providers
to
17


understand
and
honor
patients’
wishes.
An
Iowa
physician
order
18


for
scope
of
treatment
form
is
intended
for
individuals
who
19


are
frail
and
elderly
or
who
have
a
chronic,
critical
medical
20


condition
or
a
terminal
illness.

EXPLANATION
19


This

The

that

the
importance
of
encouraging
23


individuals
to
discuss
and
make
health
care
decisions
before
an
24


actual
decision
is
necessary;
that
health
care
planning
is
a
25


process
based
upon
the
individual’s
values
and
personal
health
26


status;
and
that
advance
directives
provide
the
opportunity
27


for
an
individual
to
enunciate
and
document
their
wishes
and
28


to
identify
the
person
authorized
to
make
decisions
for
the
29


individual.
The

also
recognizes
that
the
