and

v.

15


ARTICLE
I
16


By
unconstitutionally
exercising
functions
properly
17


belonging
to
the
legislative
and
executive
departments
18


as
follows:
19


(1)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Justice
Hecht
20


improperly
assumed
the
function
and
role
of
an
elected
21


legislator
by
ordering
that
the
language
in
Iowa
Code
22


section
595.2
limiting
civil
marriage
to
a
man
and
a
23


woman
must
be
stricken
from
the
statute
as
enacted
by
24


the
legislative
department
and
approved
by
the
governor
25


of
the
executive
department
in
1998.
26


(2)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Justice

27


knowingly
and
intentionally
usurped

H.R.

delegated
solely
and
exclusively
to
the
legislative
1


department
of
declaring
public
policy,
through
his
2


judicial
declaration
of
a
new
public
policy
contrary
to
3


long-standing
public
policy
acknowledged
by
society
and
4


established
in
Iowa
Code
section
595.2,
subsection
1.
5


(3)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Justice
Hecht
6


has
improperly
required
the
executive
department
to
7


issue
marriage
licenses
to
parties
of
the
same
sex
in
8


direct
contravention
of
Iowa
Code
section
595.2.
9


(4)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Justice
Hecht
10


has
created
a
constitutional
crisis
regarding
the
11


enforcement
of
the
Varnum
ruling
by
allowing
different
12


interpretations
of
the
definition
of
marriage
to
13


exist
indefinitely
within
the
separate
departments
of
14


government,
leaving
the
people
with
no
immediate
remedy
15


to
address
this
crisis.
16


(5)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Justice
17


Hecht
has
created
a
constitutional
imbalance
and
18


confusion
within
the
State
of
Iowa
as
to
the
proper
19


constitutional
function
of
each
department,
thus
20


undermining
the
integrity
of
the
tripartite
separation
21


of
powers
among
the
departments
and
creating
social
22


disorder
and
unrest.
23


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED
BY
THE
HOUSE,
That
the
24


conduct
of
Supreme
Court
Justice
Daryl
L.
Hecht,
in
25


committing
malfeasance
in
office,
warrants
impeachment,
26


trial
by
the
Senate,
and
removal
and
disqualification
27


from
any
office
of
honor,
trust,
or
profit
under
the
28


state
pursuant
to
the
procedures
set
out
in
Iowa
Code
29


chapter
68.
