whole-body
5


scanner
screening
to

the
bill
allows
a
governmental
8


subdivision
to
require
the

10


The

14


as

of
a
search

a
publicly

15


building

A

who
violates
this
16


provision
of
the
bill
commits
a
serious
misdemeanor.

26


related

the
images
generated
by
whole-body
scanners,
the
27


overall
effectiveness
of
whole-body
scanners,
and
the
health
28


risks
associated
with
repeated
exposures
to
such
screenings.
29


The
bill
also
requires
the
administrator
of
the
homeland
30


security
and
emergency
management
division
of
the
department
31


of
public
defense
to
study

of
repeated
exposure
32


to
whole-body
scanner
screenings
on
the
health
and
safety
of
33


operators,
