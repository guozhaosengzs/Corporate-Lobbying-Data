EXPLANATION

This

strikes
a
requirement
that
a
school
district
21


have
a
qualified
guidance
counselor
licensed
by
the
board
22


of
educational
examiners,
strikes

goal
of
having
one
23


qualified
guidance
counselor
for
every
350
students
enrolled
24


in
a
school
district,
strikes
a
provision
requiring
the
state
25


board
of
education
to
establish
in
rule
a
definition
of
and
26


standards
for
an
articulated
sequential
kindergarten
through
27


grade
12
guidance
and
counseling
program,
strikes
a
provision
28


that
authorizes
the
school
budget
review
committee
to
grant
29


supplemental
aid
or
modified
allowable
growth
to
school
30


districts
adding
one
or
more
guidance
counselors,
and
makes
31


conforming
changes
and
eliminates
related
out-of-date
language.
