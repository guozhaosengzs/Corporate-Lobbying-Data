occur
during
a

9.
Federal
determination
governs.
In
determining
whether
3


an
employee
is
an
unauthorized
alien,
the
court
shall
consider
4


only
the
federal
government’s
determination
pursuant
to
8
5


U.S.C.
§
1373(c).
The
federal
government’s
determination
6

a
rebuttable
presumption

status.

federal
8

of
12


this
section,
proof
of
verifying
the
employment
authorization
13


of
an
employee
through
the
e-verify
program
creates
a
14


rebuttable
presumption
that
an
employer
did
not
knowingly
15


employ
an
unauthorized
alien.
16


11.
Good-faith
compliance.
For
the
purposes
of
this
17


section,
an
employer
that
establishes
that
it
has
complied
18


in
good
faith
with
the
requirements
of
8
U.S.C.
§

establishes
an
affirmative

is

considered
to
have
complied
with
the
requirements
of
8
U.S.C.
§
22


1324a(b),
notwithstanding
an
isolated,
sporadic,
or
accidental
23


technical

Entrapment
as
affirmative
defense.
26


a.
It
is
an
affirmative
defense
to
a
violation
of
subsection
27


1
that
the
employer
was
entrapped.
To
claim
entrapment,
the
28


employer
must
admit
by
the
employer’s
testimony
or
other
29


evidence
the
substantial
elements
of
the
violation.
An
30


employer
who
asserts
an
entrapment
defense
has
the
burden
31


of
proving
all
of
the
following
by
a
preponderance
of
the
32


evidence:
33


(1)
The
idea
of
committing
the
violation
started
with
law
34


enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
rather
than
with
the

employer.
1


(2)
The
law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
urged
and
2


induced
the
employer
to
commit
the
violation.
3


(3)
The
employer
was
not
predisposed
to
commit
the
violation
4


before
the
law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
urged
and
5


induced
the
employer
to
commit
the
violation.
6


b.
An
employer
does
not
establish
entrapment
if
the
employer
7


was
predisposed
to
violate
subsection
1
and
the
law
enforcement
8


officers
or
their
agents
merely
provided
the
employer
with
an
9


opportunity
to
commit
the
violation.
It
is
not
entrapment
for
10


law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
merely
to
use
a
ruse
11


or
to
conceal
their
identity.
The
conduct
of
law
enforcement
12


officers
and
their
agents
may
be
considered
in
determining
if
13


an
employer
has
proven
entrapment.

EXPLANATION
15


This
bill
prohibits

The

directs
the
attorney

17


to
prescribe
a

of
18


the

The
bill
provides
that
complaints
may
be
19


submitted
to
the
attorney
general
or
the
county
attorney
in
20


the
county
in
which
the
alleged
unauthorized
alien
is
or
was
21


employed
by
the
employer.
The
bill
directs
the
attorney
22


general
or
county
attorney
to
investigate
complaints
they
23


receive,
and
to
verify
the
work
authorization
of
an
alleged
24


unauthorized
alien
with
the
federal
government.
The
bill
25


prohibits
the

general
or

attorney
from
26


investigating
complaints
that
are
based
solely
on
race,

The

The

requires
the
attorney
general
or
county
attorney
1


to
notify
United
States
immigration
and
customs
enforcement,
2


the
local
law
enforcement
agency,
and,
if
the
attorney
general
3


is
the
one
investigating,
the
county
attorney
of
a
complaint
4


that
is
not
false
and
not
frivolous.
The
bill
requires
the
5


county
attorney
to
bring
an
action
in
district
court
against
an
6


employer
for
a
violation
in
the
county
where
the
unauthorized
7


alien
employee
is
or
was
employed
by
the
employer.
The
bill
8


provides
that
such
an
action
must
be
expedited
by
the
court.
9


The
bill
provides
that
for
a
first
violation,
the
court
10


must
order
the
employer
to
terminate
the
employment
of
all
11


unauthorized
aliens
and
to
submit
a
signed
sworn
affidavit
12


to
that
effect
or
face
suspension
of
business
licenses
by
13


appropriate
agencies.
The
court
will

must
20


order
the
permanent
revocation
of
the

business
21


licenses.
The
bill
directs

22


online
database
of
first-time

23


The

by
the
federal
government
in
determining
the
25


immigration
status
of
an
alleged
unauthorized
alien
employed
by
26


an
employer.
The
bill
provides
that
a
determination
of
lawful
27


status
by
the
federal
government
will
create
a
rebuttable
28


presumption
of
the
employee’s
lawful
status,
as
well
as
a
29


rebuttable
presumption
that
an
employer
did
not
knowingly
30


employ
an
unauthorized
alien.
The
bill
provides
that
an
31


employer
who
establishes
that
the
employer
complied
in
good
32


faith
with
8
U.S.C.
§
1324a(b)
establishes
an
affirmative
33


defense
that
the
employer
did
not
knowingly

unauthorized
alien.

The
bill
provides
an
employer
with
an
affirmative
defense
of
5


entrapment
if
certain
elements
are
met.
6


The
bill
requires
an
employer
hiring
a
new
employee
to
7


verify
the
employee’s
employment
eligibility
through
the
8


federal
e-verify
program.
The
bill
requires
the
employer
9


to
keep
records
of
the
verification
for
the
duration
of
the
10


employee’s
employment
or
three
years,
whichever
is
longer.
The
11


bill
requires
an
employer
receiving
an
economic
development
12


incentive
from
a
state
government
entity
to
register
with
the
13


federal
e-verify
program.
The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
14


who
does
not
comply
with
the
requirement
must
repay
all
moneys
15


received
for
the
economic
development
incentive.
The
bill
16


provides
an
employer
the
right
to
appeal
a
determination
of
17


noncompliance,
and
does
not
require
repayment
until
a
final
18


determination
of
noncompliance
is
made.
The
bill
directs
the
19


attorney
general
to
request
from
the
United
States
department
20


of
homeland
security
a
list
of
employers
registered
with
the
21


e-verify
program
every
three
months.
The
bill
directs
the
22


attorney
general
to
make
the
list
available
on
the
attorney
23


general’s
internet
site.
24


The
bill
provides
that
the
bill
shall
not
be
construed
25


to
require
an
employer
to
take
any
action
that
the
employer
26


believes
in
good
faith
would
violate
federal
or
state
law.
27


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
28


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
29


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
30


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
31


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
32


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
33


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
