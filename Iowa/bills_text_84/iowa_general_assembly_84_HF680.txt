H.F.

property
taxes
for
land
established
as
a
forest
or
fruit-tree
1


reservation.
In
order
to
qualify
for
the
tax
exemption,
a
2


forest
reservation
must
have
a
minimum
of
two
acres
with
not
3


less
than
200
trees
per
acre
and
a
fruit-tree
reservation
must
4


have
at
least
10
acres
with
at
least
40
apple
trees
or
70
5


other
fruit
trees.
The
exemption
applies
in
perpetuity
for
6


forest
tree
reservations
(Code
section
427C.2)
and
eight
years
7


for
fruit-tree
reservations
(Code
section
427C.7).
Neither
8


reservation
can
be
used
for
grazing
livestock
or
economic
gain
9


(Code
section
427C.10).
In
order
to
qualify
for
the
exemption,
10


an
application
must
be
filed
with
the
assessor
by
February
1
11


(Code
sections
427C.3
and
427C.7).
The
owner
is
required
to
12


maintain
the
area
as
a
reservation
and
not
use
the
area
for
13


economic
gain
for
five
years
following
the
last
exemption
year
14


(Code
section
427C.12).
15


The
bill
provides
that
an
application
must
be
filed
and
16


accepted
on
or
before
February
1,
2012.
For
a
fruit-tree
17


reservation,
the
tax
exemption
expires
at
the
end
of
its
18


eight-year
term,
and
for
a
forest
tree
reservation,
the
tax
19


exemption
expires
on
the
last
date
of
the
tax
year
ending
in
20


2021.
In
both
cases,
the
tax
credit
expires
earlier
if
the
21


area
is
no
longer
eligible.
