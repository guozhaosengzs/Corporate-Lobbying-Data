1.
The
general
assembly
finds
all
of
the
following:
21


a.
Technology

to
support
health
care-related
functions

23


technology
provides
a
mechanism
to
transform
the
delivery
of
24


health
and
medical
care
in
Iowa
and
across
the
nation.
25


b.
A
health

involves
the
secure
26


electronic
sharing
of
health
information
across
the
boundaries
27


of
individual
practice
and
institutional
health
settings
and
28


with
consumers.
Broad
use
of
health
information
technology

health
care

It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
that
Iowa
34


establish
a

EXPLANATION
17


This
bill
provides
for
the
creation
of
a
statewide
Iowa
18


health
information
network
(network).
The
bill
provides
19


definitions
used
in
the
bill.
The
bill
provides
findings
and
20


intent
for
the
network,
describing
the
importance
of
health
21


information
technology
in
transforming
the
delivery
of
health
22


and
medical
care
in
the
state
and
across
the
nation
and
in
23


improving
health
care
quality
and
the
overall
health
of
the
24


population,
increasing
efficiencies
in
administrative
health
25


care,
reducing
unnecessary
health
care
costs,
and
preventing
26


medical
errors.
The
network
is
to
provide
for
the
secure
27


electronic
sharing
of
health
information.
The
bill
provides
28


that
it
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
establish
29


a
statewide
Iowa
health
information
network,
which
is
not
30


to
constitute
a
health
benefit
network
or
health
insurance
31


network;
and
is
not
to
preclude
the
formation
and
operation
32


of
regional,
population-specific,
or
local
health
information
33


networks
or
their
participation
in
the
statewide
network.
34


The
bill

with

department
of
public
health
and
the
1


advice
of
the
existing
electronic
health
information
executive
2


committee
and
advisory
council,
is
to
establish
and
annually
3


review
and
update
a
business
and
financial
sustainability
4


plan
for
the
network.
The
plan
shall
include
fees
to
be
paid
5


by
participants
who
access
and
use
the
network.
The
fee
6


schedule
is
to
be
structured
using
fair
share
and
value-based
7


principles.
The
department
is
directed
to
update
and
submit
8


a
financial
model
to
the
executive
committee
and
the
board
9


annually.
10


The
bill
specifies
the
duties
of
the
department
in
the
11


day-to-day
operations
of
the
Iowa
health
information
network.
12


The
bill
provides
for
the
creation
of
a
separate
Iowa
13


health
information
network
fund
within
the
state
treasury
14


under
the
control
of
the
board.
All
revenues,
donations,
15


gifts,
interest,
participant
fees,
and
other
moneys
received
or
16


generated
relative
to
the
network
are
to
be
deposited
in
the
17


fund.
Moneys
in
the
fund
are
appropriated
to
and
are
only
to
18


be
expended
by
the
department
on
activities
and
operations
of
19


the
Iowa
health
information
network,
subject
to
board
approval.
20


Moneys
in
the
fund
at
the
end
of
each
fiscal
year
remain
in
the
21


fund.
The
fund
is
subject
to
financial
and
compliance
audits
22


by
the
auditor
of
state.
23


The
bill
provides
for
the
technical
infrastructure
of
24


the
network.
The
network
is
to
provide
a
mechanism
to
25


facilitate
and
support
the
secure
exchange
of
electronic
health
26


information.
The
network
is
not
to
function
as
a
central
27


repository
of
all
health
information,
and
is
to
provide
a
means
28


for
participants
without
an
electronic
health
record
system
to
29


access
health
information
through
the
network.
30


The
bill
includes
provisions
relating
to
the
legal
and
31


policy
aspects
of
the
network.
The
bill
authorizes
the
32


department,
with
approval
from
the
board,
to
develop
security
33


standards,
policies,
and
procedures
to
protect
the

information
