12


The
first
amendment
creates
a
state
general

The

the
limitation
is
99
percent
of

estimate.
The
amendment
defines
adjusted

The

the
governor
in
preparation
19


of
the
governor’s
budget
and

general
assembly
in

20


budget
process.
The
governor
is
prohibited
from
approving
or
21


disapproving
of
appropriations
in
a
manner
that
would
cause
the
22


final
budget
approved
by
the
governor
to
exceed
the
expenditure
23


limitation.
24


The
first
amendment
also
provides
that
if
a
new
revenue
25


source
is
established
and
implemented,
95
percent
of
the
26


estimate
of
that
new
revenue
shall
be
included
in
the
27


expenditure
limitation.
28


The
first
amendment
provides
that
if
there
is
a
surplus
29


existing
at
the
end
of
a
fiscal
year
which
exceeds
10
percent
30


of
the
adjusted
revenue
for
the
fiscal
year
and
the
actual
net
31


revenue
for
the
general
fund
for
the
fiscal
year
exceeds
the
32


adjusted
revenue
estimate
for
the
fiscal
year,
the
surplus
is
33


required
to
be
transferred
to
a
taxpayers
trust
fund.

34


surplus
which
is
equal
