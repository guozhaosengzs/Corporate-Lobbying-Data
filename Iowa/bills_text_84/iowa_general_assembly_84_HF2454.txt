EXPLANATION
5


This
bill
relates
to
economic
development
by
modifying
the
6


innovation
fund
investment
tax
credit
and
allowing
the
Iowa
7


innovation
corporation
to
establish
an
innovation
fund.
8


Under
current
law,
the
economic
development
authority
is
9


required
to
issue
nontransferable
tax
credit
certificates
10


equal
to
20
percent
of
a
taxpayer’s
equity
investment
in
an
11


innovation
fund.
The
tax
credits
available
for
issuance
are
12


limited
to
a
total
of
$8
million
per
fiscal
year.
13


The
bill
modifies
the
credit
by
removing
the
20
percent
14


limitation
and
specifying
that
for
each
fiscal
year
a
total
15


of
$8
million
in
innovation
fund
investment
tax
credit
16


certificates
shall
be
issued
by
the
authority
to
one
or
17


more
nonprofit
corporations
operating
an
innovation
fund.
A
18


nonprofit
corporation
which
receives
a
tax
credit
certificate
19


from
the
authority
shall
only
transfer
the
certificate
to
20


taxpayers
who
agree
to
invest
in
an
innovation
fund.
The
bill
21


makes
the
tax
credit
certificates
transferable
and
establishes
22


procedures
for
transferring
the
credit
to
another
person
or
23


entity.
24


The
bill
provides
that
any
innovation
tax
credit
certificate
25


issued
by
the
authority
cannot
pledge
the
credit
of
the
state
26


and
shall
not
constitute
a
contract
binding
the
state
if
the
27


certificate
is
pledged
to
secure
a
debt
of
the
taxpayer.
28


The
bill
adds
an
additional
requirement
for
certification
of
29


an
innovation
fund
which
requires
an
applicant
fund
to
meet
any
30


other
criteria
adopted
by
the
economic
development
authority
31


by
rule.
32


The
bill
allows
the
Iowa
innovation
corporation
to
establish
33


an
innovation
fund
for
purposes
of
stimulating
early-stage
34


and
seed
capital
investment
in
the
state.
