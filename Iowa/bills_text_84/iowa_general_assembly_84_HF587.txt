EXPLANATION

This
bill
makes
changes
relating
to
vehicular
transportation
10


for
students.
11


The
bill
assigns
to
area
education
agencies
the
duty
of
12


initially
reviewing
transportation
disputes
between
school
13


districts
and
the
authority
to
resolve
such
disputes.
The
bill
14


requires
the
reviewing
agency
board
to
notify
each
affected
15


local
school
board
of
its
decision,
and
allows
an
affected
16


school
district
to
appeal
a
decision
to
the
director
of
the
17


department
of
education.
18


The
bill
provides
that
school-owned
vehicles
designed
to
19


carry
not
more

used
to
transport
20


pupils

minimum
vehicle
safety
inspection

22


school

as
far
as

23


board

24


drivers
of

25


owned,
are
exempt

26


of
