The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
1


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
2


This
bill
relates
to
the
apportionment
of
income
of
an
3


airline
and
of
a
qualified
air
freight
forwarder
for
purposes
4


of
the
Iowa
corporate
income
tax.
5


A
corporation
doing
business
both
within
and
without
Iowa
is
6


required
to
apportion
its
business
income
among
Iowa
and
the
7


other
states
in
which
it
does
business.
The
amount
of
business
8


income
apportioned
to
Iowa
is
generally
in
the
same
percentage
9


as
the
business’s
gross
sales
made
within
Iowa
if
the
business
10


involves
the
manufacture
or
sale
of
goods
and
products,
or
in
11


the
same
percentage
as
the
business’s
gross
receipts
earned
12


within
Iowa
if
the
business
involves
something
other
than
the
13


manufacture
or
sale
of
goods
and
products.
However,
airlines
14


and
other
specified
industries
have
special
rules
provided
15


by
administrative
rule
for
apportioning
the
income
of
those
16


industries.
17


Under
current
law
pursuant
to
701
Iowa
administrative
code,
18


rule
54.7(2),
an
airline
deriving
income
from
transportation
19


operations
is
required
to
apportion
its
business
income
to
20


Iowa
in
the
same
proportion
that
its
mileage
traveled
in
Iowa
21


bears
to
its
total
mileage
traveled
everywhere.
The
bill
22


specifies
that
an
airline
shall
apportion
this
business
income
23


in
the
same
manner
described
above
as
required
under
701
Iowa
24


administrative
code,
rule
54.7(2).
25


The
bill
also
provides
rules
for
apportioning
income
derived
26


by
a
qualified
air
freight
forwarder
from
transportation
27


operations
through
an
affiliated
airline.
The
bill
defines
28


“qualified
air
freight
forwarder”
to
be
a
taxpayer
that
is
29


primarily
engaged
in
the
facilitation
of
the
transportation
of
30


property
by
air,
and
that
does
not
itself
operate
aircraft
but
31


that
is
in
the
same
affiliated
group
as
an
airline.
32


The
bill
states
that
the
qualified
air
freight
forwarder
33


income
derived
from
transportation
operations
shall
be
34


apportioned
to
Iowa
either
under
the
current
rules
