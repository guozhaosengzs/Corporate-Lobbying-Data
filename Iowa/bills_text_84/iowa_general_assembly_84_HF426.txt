The

section

The

makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
21


subsection

which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
22


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
23


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
24


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
25


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
