28


of

The

31


offers

without
raising
taxes,
the
effect
of
such
adjustments
1


on
the
normal
standard
of
services,
and
the
power
of
the
2


public
employer
to
appropriate
funds
for
the
conduct
of
its
3


operations.
The
bill
prohibits
an
arbitrator
from
selecting
a
4


final
offer
for
which
the
arbitrator
determines
the
particular
5


public
employer
would
not
be
able
to
finance
the
cost.
The
6


bill
sets
out
additional
factors
which
an
arbitrator
must
7


consider
after
the
arbitrator
has
determined
the
ability
of
the
8


public
employer
to
pay
for
the
final
offers
on
each
impasse
9


item.
The
additional
factors
are
past
collective
bargaining
10


contracts
between
the
parties
including
the
bargaining
that
11


led
up
to
such
contracts
and
comparison
of
wages,
hours,
and
12


conditions
of
employment
of
the
involved
public
employees
with
13


those
of
other
public
and
private
employees
within
the
midwest,
14


giving
preference
to
comparisons
within
the
state,
doing
15


comparable
work.
The
bill
removes
the
power
of
the
public
16


employer
to
levy
taxes
for
the
conduct
of
its
operations
from
17


the
factors
an
arbitrator
shall
consider.
