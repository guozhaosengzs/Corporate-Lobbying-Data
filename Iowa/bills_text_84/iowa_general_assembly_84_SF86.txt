Legislative
findings.
The

finds
that
13


when

is
jeopardized.
The
general

declares
that
all
16


students
have
a
right
to
work
and
study
in
a
safe,
supportive
17


environment
that
is
free
from
harassment,
intimidation,
and
18


violence.
It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
that
the
19


board
of
directors
of
each
school
district
shall
establish
a
20


policy
to
create
an
environment
free
of
dating
violence
and
for
21


responding
to
incidents
of
dating
violence,
and
shall
provide

reporting
procedures,

The
