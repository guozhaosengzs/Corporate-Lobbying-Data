EXPLANATION
14


This
bill
requires
a
person
under
18
years
of
age
to
wear
15


a
safety
helmet
when
operating
a
motorized
bicycle.
The
bill
16


specifies
that
the
safety
helmet
must
meet
federal
standards
17


for
motorcycle
helmets
and
must
be
worn
by
the
driver
at
all
18


times
when
the
motorized
bicycle
is
in
motion.
A
violation
of
19


the
helmet
requirement
is
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
20


scheduled
fine
of
$100.
21


Pursuant
to
current
law,
a
violation
of
a
requirement
22


for
operation
of
a
motorized
bicycle
qualifies
as
a
moving
23


violation
and,
as
such,
is
grounds
for
cancellation
of
the
24


person’s
license
to
operate
a
motorized
bicycle.
A
person
25


whose
license
is
canceled
may
reapply
for
a
license
after
30
26


days.
If
a
person
has
an
instruction
permit
or
intermediate
27


driver’s
license,
a
conviction
for
a
moving
violation
subjects
28


the
permittee
or
licensee
to
remedial
driver
improvement
action
29


and
may
be
cause
for
suspension
of
the
license
or
permit.
30


If
the
person
has
a
special
minor’s
license,
or
“school”
31


license,
a
conviction
for
a
moving
violation
is
grounds
for
32


license
suspension
at
the
discretion
of
the
department
of
33


transportation,
and
two
such
violations
result
in
mandatory
34


revocation
of
the
license.
