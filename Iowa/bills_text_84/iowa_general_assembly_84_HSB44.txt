the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
7


This
bill
modifies
provisions
relating
to
the
registration
8


and
titling
of
vessels.
9


The
bill
provides
that
a
vessel
shall
initially
be
10


registered
with
the
county
recorder
in
the
county
in
which
11


the
owner
resides,
but
that
registration
may
subsequently
be
12


renewed
every
three
years
with
any
county
recorder.
To
receive
13


the
same
vessel
registration
number,
an
applicant
must
apply
14


for
a
registration
renewal
within
60
days
of
expiration
of
the
15


registration,
instead
of
the
previous
requirement
that
the
16


application
be
submitted
in
a
timely
fashion.
The
bill
changes
17


the
date
after
which
a
$5
penalty
will
be
charged
for
failure
18


to
renew
registration
from
May
1
of
the
last
calendar
year
of
19


the
registration
period
to
July
1
of
the
last
calendar
year
of
20


the
registration
period.
21


The
bill
removes
the
requirement
that
a
registrant
who
moves
22


notify
the
county
recorder
in
writing
of
the
registrant’s
old
23


and
new
address.
The
registrant
must
simply
inform
any
county
24


recorder
of
the
new
address.
The
county
recorder
does
not
have
25


to
forward
all
past
records
of
the
vessel
to
the
recorder
of
26


the
county
in
which
the
owner
now
resides.
The
bill
allows
27


a
registrant
whose
name
has
changed
to
inform
any
county
28


recorder.
29


Under
the
bill,
when
a
registration
certificate
is
lost,
30


mutilated,
or
becomes
illegible,
or
when
a
certificate
of
title
31


is
lost,
stolen,

32


the
owner
(or
first
lienholder)
shall
apply
for

county,

either
3


the
title
of
the
vessel
under
the
transferee’s
name
or,
if

titled,
a
person
must
assign

8


Contrary
to
current
law,
if

expired
at

time
of
transfer,
a
transfer
of

10


not
need
to
be
awarded
in
the
same
manner
as
provided
for
in
11


an
original
registration.
Current
law
also
requires,
unless
12


otherwise
provided
in
Code
chapter
462A,
that
an
owner
must
13


provide
a
purchaser
or
transferee
of
a
vessel
the
registration
14


certificate
for
the
vessel
with
the
form
on
the
back
filled
in
15


completely.
16


The
bill
requires
the
department
to
determine
a
process
for
17


collecting
fees
and
penalties
from
county
recording
offices
18


and
removes
the
requirement
that
a
county
recorder
shall
remit
19


to
the
commission
all
unused
license
blanks
for
the
previous
20


registration
period.
21


The
bill
removes
the
requirement
that
an
application
for
22


a
certificate
of
title
must
be
sworn
to
before
a
notarial
23


officer.
24


Under
the
bill,
a
dealer
who
buys
or
acquires
a
used
25


vessel
for
resale
no
longer
needs
to
report
the
acquisition
26


to
the
county
recorder
on
the
forms
the
department
provides.
27


The
dealer
may
apply
for
and
obtain
a
certificate
of
title
28


as
provided
in
Code
chapter
462A.
The
bill
removes
the
29


requirement
that
the
dealer
apply
for
a
certificate
of
title
in
30


the
dealer’s
name
if
the
dealer
acquires
an
unnumbered
vessel.
31


A
dealer
who
transfers
ownership
of
a
snowmobile,
all-terrain
32


vehicle,
or
vessel
will
have
30
days
to
forward
all
