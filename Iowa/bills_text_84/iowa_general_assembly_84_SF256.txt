community

and

services
to
all

requires

or

the
threshold
at
which
a

district
is
prohibited
from
8


expending

12


COUNTY
SCHOOL
SUPERINTENDENT.
New
Code
chapter
273A
13


establishes
the
office
of
county
school
superintendent
and
14


the
administration
of
school
districts
located
in
more
than
15


one
county,
provides
for
the
appointment
of
the
county
school
16


superintendent
and
the
employment
of
personnel,
and
establishes
17


that
for
every
8,000
students,
the
office
may
employ
not
18


more
than
one
individual
in
each
of
the
following
positions:
19


assistant
county
school
superintendent,
chief
finance
officer,
20


chief
operating
officer,
human
resources
director,
community
21


relations
director,
transportation
director,
and
legal
counsel.
22


The
bill
lists
the
general
powers
and
duties
of
the
county
23


school
superintendent,
but
permits
the
boards
of
the
school
24


districts
administered
by
the
office
to
jointly
determine
and
25


approve
additional
powers
and
duties.
26


Based
on
the
enrollment
of
each
school
district
administered
27


by
the
office,
the
county
school
superintendent
must
determine
28


the
amount
each
school
district
shall
pay
for
the
office’s
29


operations
based
upon
the
proportion
that
the
enrollment
of
30


a
school
district
bears
to
the
sum
of
the
enrollments
of
all
31


school
districts
administered
by
the
office
as
reported
for
the
32


base
year.
33


The
bill
also
provides
for
the
powers
and
duties
of
the
34


boards
of
directors
of
the
school
districts
administered
by
the
35


-11-

office,
which
include
the
authority
to
approve
the
curriculum
1


recommended
by
the
county
school
superintendent
in
conformity
2


with
the
core
curriculum
and
the
core
content
standards
3


established
and
adopted
by
the
state
board
of
education.
The
4


bill
permits
a
school
district
board
to
enter
into
a
contract
5


with
the
office
for
services
in
addition
to
those
services
the
6


office
provides
uniformly
to
all
boards.
7


Under
the
bill,
the
acting
county
school
superintendent
8


initially
employed
by
a
school
district
will
be
the
individual
9


who
is
currently
employed
by
a
school
district
and
who
has
the
10


most
years
of
employment
as
a
public
school
superintendent
11


in
the
county.
The
acting
county
school
superintendent
will
12


serve
a
term
of
three
years
or
until
the
school
district
boards
13


administered
by
the
office
jointly
appoint
a
county
school
14


superintendent,
whichever
occurs
first.
15


The
bill
makes
a
number
of
conforming
changes.
The
16


bill
strikes
a
provision
that
allows
an
individual
who
is
17


employed
or
contracted
as
a
superintendent
to
also
serve
as
an
18


elementary
or
secondary
principal
in
the
same
school
or
school
19


district.
Because
the
school
districts
administered
by
an
20


office,
under
the
bill,
will
be
sharing
operational
services,
21


the
bill
also
eliminates
the
supplementary
weighting
of
two
22


hundredths
per
pupil
that
school
districts
may
qualify
for
if
23


they
share
operational
functions
with
a
political
subdivision.
24


REORGANIZATION.
The
bill
provides
that
if
a
school
district
25


with
a
total
enrollment
of
fewer
than
750
students,
or
a
school
26


district
that
does
not
operate
a
secondary
school
does
not
27


reorganize
within
six
months,
the
state
board
of
education
28


shall
attach
the
school
district
to
one
or
more
adjacent
29


districts.
The
bill
also
provides
that
if
a
school
district
30


with
an
enrollment
of
750
or
less
in
grades
nine
through
12,
or
31


without
a
high
school,
dissolves,
the
territory
located
in
the
32


dissolved
district
is
eligible,
if
approved
by
the
director
of
33


the
department
of
education,
for
a
reduction
in
the
foundation

FUNDING.
Currently,
a
school
district
3


with
a
certified
enrollment
of
fewer
than
250
pupils
in
the
4


entire
district
or
certified
enrollment
of
fewer

100
5


pupils
in

school
must
apply
to
the
department
of

6


for
a

can

the

or
