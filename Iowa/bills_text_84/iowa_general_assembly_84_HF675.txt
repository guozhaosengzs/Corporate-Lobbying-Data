extent

(1)
In

perfected


under
this
chapter
against
the
owner,
the
subcontractor


bears
the
burden
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence


that
the
owner
received
notice
pursuant
to
subsection
2.
A


subcontractor
may
satisfy
the
burden
of
proof
by
providing


separate
notice
to
an
owner
by
including
but
not
limited
to
any


of
the
following
means:


(a)
By
certified
mail
with
return
receipt.

with
a
signed
receipt
from
the
owner


acknowledging
notice.


(2)
If
the
subcontractor
provides
an
affidavit
of
mailing,


the
presumption
is
that
the
owner
received
the
notice
on
the


fourth
day
of
business
for
the
post
office
after
the
notice
was


sent
and
the
burden
of
proof
shifts
from
the
subcontractor
to


the
owner
to
refute
the
presumption.
