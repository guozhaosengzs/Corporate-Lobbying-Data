EXPLANATION
9


This
bill
creates
new
Code
chapter
148F
that
provides
for
10


the
licensure
of
midwives
beginning
July
1,
2013.
A
midwife
11


is
not
an
allopathic
or
osteopathic
physician
licensed
under
12


Code
chapter
148
or
a
nurse
licensed
under
Code
chapter
13


152
providing
primary
maternity
care
during
the
antepartum,
14


intrapartum,
and
postpartum
periods.
15


The
bill
sets
out
detailed
educational
and
experience
16


requirements,
including
an
individual
skills
assessment,
as
17


part
of
the
licensing
process.
The
applicant
must
also
hold
18


a
certified
professional
midwife
credential
issued
by
the
19


North
American
registry
of
midwives
or
any
other
nationally
20


accredited
credential.
The
applicant
for
licensure
must
also
21


pass
a
350-item
test.
22


The
bill
empowers
the
licensing
board
to
require
liability
23


insurance
when
the
board
determines
this
insurance
is
available
24


at
an
affordable
price.
Until
that
time
licensed
midwives
must
25


disclose
the
lack
of
insurance.
26


The
bill
provides
limited
immunity
for
a
physician,
surgeon,
27


physician
assistant,
nurse,
or
a
hospital
providing
care
for
a
28


patient
that
has
been
transferred
to
the
provider’s
care
from
29


an
out-of-hospital
setting
when
the
licensed
midwife
does
not
30


have
liability
insurance.
31


The
bill
provides
for
the
establishment
of
a
seven-member
32


board
of
midwifery
consisting
of
three
members
who
are
33


midwives,
one
physician,
one
nurse,
and
two
members
who
34


represent
the
general
public.
The
board
is
similar

composition
and
responsibilities
to
other
health-related
1


licensing
boards.
2


The
bill
provides
for
fees
to
fund
the
board
and
provides
3


penalties
for
violation
of
the
practice
requirement;
those
4


penalties
are
set
out
for
all
health-related
boards
in
Code
5


chapters
147
and
272C.
Code
section
147.86
provides
that
it
is
6


a
serious
misdemeanor
to
violate
a
provision
of
the
licensing
7


laws.
8


The
provisions
of
the
bill
amending
Code
section
147.2
and
9


enacting
Code
section
148F.8,
both
prohibiting
the
practice
of
10


midwifery
without
a
license,
take
effect
July
1,
2013.
