the

both
joint

custodial
parents
upon
the
request
of
either

the
5


proceedings
on
the
initial
dissolution
petition
or
during
the


6


proceedings
on
a
modification
of
the
original
custody
order


.
A
7


rebuttable
presumption
exists
that
a
request
for
joint
physical
8


care
by
either
parent
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
The
9


burden
of
proof
to
rebut
the
presumption
rests
on
the
party
10


denying
that
joint
physical
care
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
11


child,
and
such
party
shall
demonstrate
that
joint
physical
12


care
is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
by
clear
and
13


convincing
evidence.
14


(2)
Prior
to
ruling
on
the
request
for
the
award
of
joint
15


physical
care,
the
court
may
require
the
parents
to
submit,
16


either
individually
or
jointly,
a
proposed
joint
physical
care
17


parenting
plan.
A
proposed
joint
physical
care
parenting
plan
18


shall
address
how
the
parents
will
make
decisions
affecting
the
19


child,
how
the
parents
will
provide
a
home
for
the
child,
how
20


the
child’s
time
will
be
divided
between
the
parents
and
how
21


each
parent
will
facilitate
the
child’s
time
with
the
other
22


parent,
arrangements
in
addition
to
court-ordered
child
support
23


for
the
child’s
expenses,
how
the
parents
will
resolve
major
24


changes
or
disagreements
affecting
the
child
including
changes
25


that
arise
due
to
the
child’s
age
and
developmental
needs,
and
26


any
other
issues
the
court
may
require.
27


(3)


If
the
court
finds
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
28


that
joint
physical
care
is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
29


child
and
denies
the
request
for
joint
physical
care,
the
30


determination
shall
be
accompanied
by
specific
findings
of
fact
31


and
conclusions
of
law
that
the
awarding
of
joint
physical
care
32


is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
In
determining
the


33


best
interest
of
the
child
relative
to
the
denial
of
a
request


34


for
joint
physical
care,
the
court
shall
consider
that

interest
of
the

includes
the
opportunity
for
the
maximum

continuous
physical
and
emotional
contact
possible

EXPLANATION
5


This
bill
provides
that
in
awarding
joint
physical
care
to
6


parents,
joint
physical
care
may
be
awarded
to
both
parents
7


based
upon
a
request
by
either
parent
during
the
proceedings
8


on
the
initial
dissolution
petition
or
during
the
proceedings
9


on
a
modification
of
the
original
custody
order.
The
bill
10


creates
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
a
request
for
joint
11


physical
care
by
either
parent
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
12


child,
places
the
burden
of
proof
to
rebut
the
presumption
13


on
the
party
denying
that
joint
physical
care
is
in
the
best
14


interest
of
the
child,
and
requires
such
party
to
demonstrate
15


that
joint
physical
care
is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
16


the
child
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
The
bill
also
17


requires
that
if
the
court
denies
joint
physical
care,
the
18


court
must
base
the
findings
on
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
19


In
determining
the
best
interest
of
the
child
relative
to
20


the
denial
of
a
request
for
joint
physical
care,
the
court
21


is
required
to
consider
that
the
best
interest
of
the
child
22


includes
the
opportunity
for
the
maximum
continuous
physical
23


and
emotional
contact
possible
with
both
parents,
unless
direct
24


physical
or
significant
emotional
harm
to
the
child
may
result
25


from
this
contact.
