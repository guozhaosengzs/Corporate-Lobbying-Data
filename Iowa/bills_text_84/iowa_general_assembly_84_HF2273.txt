The

the
applicant
24


and
the
ambulatory
surgical
center
comply
with
Code
chapter
25


135P
and
the
rules
of
the
department.
A
licensee
receives
26


reapproval
upon
payment
of
the
$500
license
fee
and
filing
27


an
application
form
available
from
the
DIA.
Licenses
are
28


general
or
restricted
in
form.
A

33


premises
as
prescribed
by
department
rules.
