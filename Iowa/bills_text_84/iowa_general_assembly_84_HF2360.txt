EXPLANATION
3


This
bill
relates
to
licensing
provisions
governing
real
4


estate
brokers
and
real
estate
salespersons
contained
in
Code
5


chapter
543B.
6


The
bill
modifies
provisions
in
Code
section
543B.7
which
7


exclude
the
acts
of
an
auctioneer
in
conducting
a
public
8


sale
or
auction
from
the
provisions
of
the
Code
chapter
9


under
specified
circumstances.
Currently,
to
qualify
for
the
10


exclusion
an
auctioneer’s
role
must
be
limited
to
establishing
11


the
time,
place,
and
method
of
an
auction;
advertising
the
12


auction
including
a
brief
description
of
the
property
for
13


auction
and
the
time
and
place
for
the
auction;
and
crying
14


the
property
at
the
auction.
The
bill
changes
this
provision
15


such
that
advertising
the
auction
shall
be
limited
to
a
brief
16


description
of
the
property
for
auction
and
the
time
and
place
17


for
the
auction.
The
bill
also
adds
providing
the
name
of
18


the
closing
company
to
individuals
or
entities
required
to
be
19


identified
by
an
auctioneer
in
advertisements.
20


The
bill
mandates
issuance
of
a
cease
and
desist
order
by
21


the
real
estate
commission
if
an
investigation
reveals
that
an
22


auctioneer
has
violated
provisions
governing
exclusion
from
the
23


Code
chapter
or
has
assumed
to
act
in
the
capacity
of
a
real
24


estate
broker
or
real
estate
salesperson.
Currently,
issuance
25


of
an
order
is
optional.
The
bill
deletes
a
current
provision
26


that
the
commission
issue
a
warning
letter
notifying
the
27


auctioneer
of
the
violation,
substituting
this
with
imposition
28


of
a
penalty
in
the
amount
of
$2,500
for
a
first
offense.
29


Additionally,
the
bill
contains
a
list
of
specifically
30


prohibited
activities
of
an
auctioneer
when
conducting
real
31


property
auctions.
32


The
bill
also
provides,
with
reference
to
commission
33


investigations
regarding
the
actions
of
a
real
estate
broker,
34


real
estate
salesperson,
or
other
person
assuming
to
act
