EXPLANATION

BACKGROUND
——
VETERINARY
ASSISTANTS.
This
bill
amends
21


provisions
relating
to
the
employment
of
a
veterinary
assistant
22


by
a
licensed
veterinarian
(Code
section
169.20).
Currently,
23


a
veterinary
assistant
certified
by
the
board
may
perform
24


services
associated
with
the
practice
of
veterinary
medicine
25


other
than
diagnosis,
prescription,
or
surgery,
if
acting
under
26


the
direct
supervision
of
such
veterinarian
and
in
compliance
27


with
rules
adopted
by
the
board
of
veterinary
medicine
(board).
28


BILL
——
AUTHORIZED
PERSONS
DESIGNATED.
The
bill
renames
29


the
term
“veterinary
assistant”
as
“certified
veterinary
30


assistant”
and
establishes
two
other
classes
of
persons
who
may
31


be
employed
by
a
licensed
veterinarian:
a
certified
veterinary
32


technician
and
a
noncredentialed
veterinary
assistant.
Under
33


the
bill,
a
certified
veterinary
technician
must
have
graduated
34


from
an
accredited
program
of
technology
as
approved
by
the
35


-3-


LSB
5316SV
(2)

S.F.
2303


board
and
have
passed
one
or
more
examinations
prescribed
1


by
the
board.
A
certified
veterinary
assistant
must
have
2


completed
a
program
approved
by
the
board
or
have
on-the-job
3


experience
and
pass
an
examination
prescribed
by
the
board.
4


The
bill
also
provides
for
a
noncredentialed
veterinary
5


assistant
who
is
someone
other
than
a
certified
veterinary
6


assistant
or
certified
veterinary
technician.
The
bill
7


authorizes
each
class
of
person
to
perform
duties
associated
8


with
the
practice
of
veterinary
medicine,
but
allows
the
board
9


to
distinguish
further
their
respective
scopes
of
authority.
10


The
bill
provides
that
a
certified
veterinary
assistant,
11


certified
veterinary
technician,
or
noncredentialed
veterinary
12


assistant
cannot
provide
diagnosis,
prescription,
or
surgery.
13


The
board
may
provide
for
certification
fees
in
the
same
manner
14


as
is
currently
provided
for
veterinary
assistants
(Code
15


section
169.5(9)).
16


BILL
——
AUTHORIZED
PERSONS
REGULATED.
The
bill
authorizes
17


the
board
to
regulate
certified
veterinary
assistants,
18


certified
veterinary
technicians,
and
noncredentialed
19


veterinary
assistants,
including
by
conducting
investigations
20


and
instituting
disciplinary
action,
including
the
suspension
21


or
revocation
of
a
certificate
in
the
same
manner
as
currently
22


applies
to
veterinary
assistants
(Code
section
169.5(7)(i)).
