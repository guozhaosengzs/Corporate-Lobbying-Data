The
bill
requires
that

local
authority
currently
using

an
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
system
shall
discontinue
2


using
the
system
on
or
before
the
effective
date
of
the
bill.
3


All
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
system
equipment
must
be
4


removed
from
the
highways
by
July
1,
2012.
5


A
local
authority’s
ordinance
authorizing
the
use
of
6


automated
traffic
law
enforcement
systems
is
void
on
the
7


effective
date
of
the
bill,
and
all
notices
of
fines
or
8


citations
issued
under
the
ordinance
are
invalidated.
The
bill
9


requires
a
local
authority
to
issue
refunds
within
90
days
of
10


the
effective
date
of
the
bill
to
every
person
who
paid
a
civil
11


penalty
under
an
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
program.
12


The
refunds
shall
be
prorated,
based
on
the
total
amount
that
13


accrued
to
the
city
from
the
use
of
automated
traffic
law
14


enforcement
systems
after
satisfying
contractual
obligations
15


relating
to
the
use
of
the
systems.
16


A
local
authority
that
uses
an
automated
traffic
law
17


enforcement
system
on
or
after
the
effective
date
of
the
bill
18


is
subject
to
the
withholding
of
the
city’s
allocation
from
the
19


road
use
tax
fund
in
the
amount
equal
to
10
times
the
amount
of
20


civil
penalties
collected
in
violation
of
the
bill.
21


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
22


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
23


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
24


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
25


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
26


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
27


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
28


The
bill
is
effective
upon
enactment.
