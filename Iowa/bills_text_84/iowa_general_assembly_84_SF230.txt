S.F.

considerations
urged
against
the
rule
and,
if
applicable,
a
1


brief
explanation
of
the
principal
reasons
for
its
failure
to
2


provide
in
that
rule
for
the
waiver
of
the
rule
in
specified
3


situations
if
no
such
waiver
provision
is
included
in
the
rule.
4


This
explanatory
requirement
does
not
apply
when
the
agency


5


adopts
a
rule
that
only
defines
the
meaning
of
a
provision
of


6


law
if
the
agency
does
not
possess
delegated
authority
to
bind


7


the
courts
to
any
extent
with
its
definition.
In
addition,
if
8


requested
to
do
so
by
an
interested
person,
either
prior
to
9


adoption
or
within
thirty
days
thereafter,
the
agency
shall
10


issue
a
concise
statement
of
the
principal
reasons
for
and
11


against
the
rule
adopted,
incorporating
therein
the
reasons
for
12


overruling
considerations
urged
against
the
rule.
This
concise
13


statement
shall
be
issued
either
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
14


the
rule
or
within
thirty-five
days
after
the
agency
receives
15


the
request.
16


3.
When
an
agency
for
good
cause
finds
that
notice
and
17


public
participation
would
be
unnecessary,
impracticable,
or
18


contrary
to
the
public
interest,
the
provisions
of
subsection
1
19


shall
be
inapplicable.
The
agency
shall
incorporate
in
each
20


rule
issued
in
reliance
upon
this
provision
either
the
finding
21


and
a
brief
statement
of
the
reasons
for
the
finding,
or
a
22


statement
that
the
rule
is
within
a
very
narrowly
tailored
23


category
of
rules
whose
issuance
has
previously
been
exempted
24


from
subsection
1
by
a
special
rule
relying
on
this
provision
25


and
including
such
a
finding
and
statement
of
reasons
for
the
26


entire
category.
If
the
administrative
rules
review
committee


27


by
a
two-thirds
vote,
the
governor,
or
the
attorney
general
28


files
with
the
administrative
code
editor
an
objection
to
the
29


adoption
of
any
rule
pursuant
to
this
subsection
,
that
rule
30


shall
cease
to
be
effective
one
hundred
eighty
days
after


31


the
date
the
objection
was
filed.
A
copy
of
the
objection,


32


properly
dated,
shall
be
forwarded
to
the
agency
at
the
time
of


33


filing
the
objection.


In
any
action
contesting
a
rule
adopted

pursuant
to
this
subsection
,

to
show
that
the
procedures
of
subsection
1
were

impracticable,
unnecessary,
or
contrary
to
the
public
interest

and
that,
if
a
category
of
rules
was
involved,
the
category

was

EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
makes
a
number
of
changes
to
the
rulemaking
3


process.
The
bill
requires
administrative
agencies,
when
4


feasible,
to
hold
rulemaking
hearings
in
varied
locations
5


throughout
the
state
via
the
Iowa
communications
network
and
6


provides
that
a
hearing
must
be
held
in
a
particular
city
or
7


county
when
25
interested
persons
from
that
city
or
county
make
8


the
request.
9


Every
adopted
rule
must
be
accompanied
by
a
concise
10


statement
of
the
principal
reasons
for
and
against
the
rule
11


adopted;
under
current
law
such
a
statement
is
only
provided
12


on
request.
13


The
bill
also
provides
that
so-called
“emergency”
rules
are
14


in
effect
for
only
180
days.
15


The
bill
also
establishes
a
new
rule
of
statutory
16


construction:
Unless
otherwise
specifically
provided
in
17


statute,
any
grant
of
rulemaking
authority
shall
be
construed
18


narrowly.
