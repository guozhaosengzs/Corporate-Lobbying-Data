EXPLANATION
10


This
bill
modifies
provisions
relating
to
reserving
11


specified
amounts
of
energy
production
capacity
equivalent
for
12


designated
facilities
in
qualifying
for
the
renewable
energy
13


tax
credit
provided
in
Code
chapter
476C.
14


The
Code
chapter
provides
that
the
maximum
amount
of
energy
15


production
capacity
equivalent
of
nonwind
energy
facilities
16


eligible
for
the
tax
credit
shall
not
exceed
a
specified
17


combined
output
level.
Currently,
out
of
this
amount,
a
18


maximum
of
10
megawatts
of
nameplate
generating
capacity
is
19


reserved
for
eligible
renewable
energy
facilities
incorporated
20


within
or
associated
with
an
ethanol
cogeneration
plant
21


engaged
in
the
sale
of
ethanol
to
states
to
meet
a
low
carbon
22


fuel
standard.
The
bill
modifies
this
provision
to
restrict
23


the
reserved
amount
to
natural
gas
cogeneration
facilities
24


associated
with
the
ethanol
plant.
The
bill
also
deletes
25


reference
to
an
ethanol
“cogeneration”
plant,
and
changes
the
26


provision
that
the
plant
is
engaged
in
the
sale
of
ethanol
to
27


states
to
meet
a
low
carbon
fuel
standard
to
specify
that
the
28


plant
is
engaged
in
the
sale
of
ethanol,
without
reference
to
29


other
states,
in
order
to
assist
an
ethanol
plant
in
meeting
a
30


low
carbon
fuel
standard.
31


The
bill
defines
“cogeneration
facility”
to
mean
a
facility
32


in
this
state
in
which
the
same
energy
source
is
utilized
for
33


the
