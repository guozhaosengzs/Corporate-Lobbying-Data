This
bill
allows
a
school
district
offering
four
sequential
1


units
of
a
foreign
language
in
grades
nine
through
12,
as
2


required
under
the
educational
standards
by
which
schools
3


are
accredited,
to
participate
in
and
receive
supplementary
4


weighting
under
the
district-to-community
college
sharing
or
5


concurrent
enrollment
program
for
any
foreign
language
unit
it
6


offers
if
the
unit’s
syllabus
is
equivalent
to
the
community
7


college’s
foreign
language
course
syllabus.

Currently,
the
Code
prohibits
school
districts
from

receiving

weighting
for

agreement
with
a
community
college
to
provide
such
a
course
to
11


the
school
district’s
students.
The
only
exceptions
to
the

restriction
are
for
career
and
technical
education
courses.
