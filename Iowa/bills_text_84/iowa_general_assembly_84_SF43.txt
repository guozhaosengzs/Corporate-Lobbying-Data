EXPLANATION

This
bill
extends
certain
protections
to
pioneer
cemeteries
5


that
are
available
to

A
pioneer
cemetery
is
6


defined
as
a
cemetery
where
there
were
12
or
fewer
burials
in
7


the
preceding
50
years.
A
pioneer
cemetery
is
specifically
8


excluded
from
the
definition
of
a
cemetery
for
purposes
of
9


cemetery
regulation
in
Code
chapter
523I.
10


Code
section
523I.316

not
otherwise
provided
for
under
Code
chapter
13


523I
to
notify
the
owner
of
the
land
upon
which
the
pioneer
14


cemetery
is
located
of
its
existence
and
also
the
state
15


archaeologist
if
there
is
a
basis
to
believe
that
interment
16


may
have
occurred
more
than
150
years
earlier.
A
governmental
17


subdivision
is
also
given
the
duty
to
preserve
and
protect
a
18


pioneer
cemetery
or
enter
into
an
agreement
with
the
landowner
19


on
which
the
pioneer
cemetery
is
located,
or
a
public
