EXPLANATION
18


This
bill
makes
changes
relating
to
regional
academies.
19


Currently,
a
regional
academy
is
a
program
established
20


by
a
school
district
to
which
multiple
school
districts
21


send
students
in
grades
9
through
12,
and
which
may
include
22


internet-based
coursework
and
courses
delivered
via
the
Iowa
23


communications
network.
The
bill
lowers
the
grade
level
24


limit
to
grades
7
through
12,
and
adds
that
a
school
district
25


establishing
a
regional
academy
may
collaborate
and
partner
26


with,
enter
into
an
agreement
pursuant
to
Code
chapter
28E
27


with,
or
enter
into
a
contract
with,
two
or
more
school
28


districts,
community
colleges,
accredited
public
and
private
29


postsecondary
institutions,
accredited
nonpublic
schools,
30


businesses,
and
private
agencies
located
within
or
outside
of
31


the
state.
32


The
bill
provides
that
the
purpose
of
a
regional
academy
33


shall
be
to
build
a
culture
of
innovation
for
students
and
34


community,
to

educational
and

opportunities
by
engaging
in
learning
experiences
that
involve
1


students
in
complex,
real-world
projects,
and
to
develop
2


regional
or
global
innovation
networks.
3


If
a
school
district
submits
a
plan
to
the
department
for
4


approval
that
demonstrates
how
the
regional
academy
will
5


increase
and
assess
student
achievement
or
increase
and
assess
6


competency-based
learning
opportunities
for
students,
the
7


department
may
waive
or
modify
any
statutory
or
regulatory
8


provision
applicable
to
school
districts
in
order
to
provide
9


the
regional
academy
additional
flexibility.
10


The
bill
strikes
language
that
prohibits
a
regional
academy
11


course
from
qualifying
as
a
concurrent
enrollment
course.
12


A
regional
academy
may
include
in
its
curriculum
virtual
or
13


internet-based
coursework
and
courses
delivered
via
the
Iowa
14


communications
network,
career
and
technical
courses,
core
15


curriculum
coursework,
courses
required
for
graduation
or
under
16


the
educational
standards,
and
asynchronous
learning
networks.
17


Currently,
regional
academies
may
receive
supplementary
18


weighting.
The
bill
provides
that
the
school
districts
19


participating
in
the
regional
academy
must
enter
into
an
20


agreement
on
how
the
supplementary
weighting
received
shall
21


be
used
and
must
submit
the
agreement
to
the
department
for
22


approval.
23


The
bill
eliminates
an
outdated
provision
relating
to
24


supplementary
weighting
for
regional
academies.
25


The
bill
takes
effect
July
1,
2012,
and
is
applicable
to
26


school
years
beginning
on
or
after
that
date.
