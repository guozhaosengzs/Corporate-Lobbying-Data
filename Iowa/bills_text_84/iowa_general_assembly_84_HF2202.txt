EXPLANATION
1


This
bill
requires
that
a
person
under
18
years
of
age
shall
2


wear
a
properly
adjusted
and
fastened
motorcycle
helmet
when
3


operating
or
being
transported
on
a
motorcycle
or
motorized
4


bicycle.
The
helmet
must
comply
with
federal
standards
and
5


specifications
for
motorcycle
helmets.
6


A
violation
of
the
helmet
requirement
is
a
simple
7


misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$50.
The
8


operator
of
the
motorcycle
or
motorized

and
the
9


passenger
may
each
be
charged
separately
with
a
violation.
10


However,
violations
of
helmet
requirements
may
not
be
taken
11


into
account
for
purposes
of
determining
a
person

a
12


habitual
violator
of
traffic
laws
subject
to
administrative
13


suspension
of
a
driver’s
license.
These
penalty
provisions
14


mirror
existing
law
pertaining
to
the
use
of
seat
belts.
