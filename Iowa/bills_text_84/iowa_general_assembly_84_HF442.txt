EXPLANATION
16


This
bill
relates
to
operating-while-intoxicated
offenses,
17


including
license
revocation
periods
and
ignition
interlock
18


licenses
and
devices,
and
provides
penalties.
19


Current
law
provides
that
the
department
of
transportation
20


may
issue
a
temporary
restricted
license
(also
known
as
a
21


work
permit)
for
violations
of
Code
chapter
321
(department
22


of
transportation
rules
of
the
road)
and
for
violations
of
23


Code
chapter
321J
(Iowa’s
operating-while-intoxicated
law).
24


The
bill
replaces
temporary
restricted
licenses
with
ignition
25


interlock
licenses
for
violations
of
Code
chapter
321J.
This
26


change
does
not
affect
temporary
restricted
licenses
issued
for
27


violations
of
Code
chapter
321.
28


An
“ignition
interlock
license”
is
defined
in
the
bill
as
a
29


license
which
partially
restores
a
person’s
driving
privileges
30


to
operate
a
motor
vehicle
during
the
period
a
person’s
31


driver’s
license
or
privilege
to
operate
a
motor
vehicle
is
32


suspended
or
revoked
for
violations
of
Code
chapter
321J.
The
33


bill
also
provides
for
an
ignition
interlock
restriction
on
the
34


person’s
driver’s
license
requiring

2


The
issuance
and
continuing
validity
of
both
an
ignition
3


interlock
license
and
an
ignition
interlock
restriction
4


is
conditioned
upon
the

more
noncommercial
vehicles
6


owned
or
to

or
subsequent
offense
(ineligible

the

In
addition,
a

20


offense
under

of
transportation
29


of
the

ending
dates
of

and
the
30

an

prohibits
a
person
