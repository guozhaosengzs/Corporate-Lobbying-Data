This

to
special
assessments
imposed
by
cities
16


and
counties
on
private
property
for
the
cost
of
a
public
17


improvement.
18


The
bill
establishes
definitions
of
“community
benefit”,
19


“district
benefit”,
and
“individual
benefit”
under
Code
chapter
20


384,
division
IV.
The

also
adds
storm
water
management
21


intakes,
sewers,
and

22


fixtures,

and
facilities
to
the
definition
of
23


“street

384.37.
24


The
bill
amends
the
definition
of
“district”
in
Code
section
25


384.37
to
mean
the
lots
or
parts
of
lots
within
boundaries
of
26


a
geographic
area
established
by
the
council
for
the
purpose
27


of
the
assessment
of
all
or
part
of
the
cost
of
a
public
28


improvement
that
is
intended
in
whole
or
in
part
to
provide
an
29


individual
benefit
to
such
lots
or
parts
of
lots.
30


The
bill
requires
that
prior
to
the
adoption
of
a
preliminary
31


resolution
related
to
a
public
improvement,
a
city
must
32


adopt
an
ordinance,
after
specified
notices
and
a
hearing,
33


setting
forth
the
method
to
be
used
in
determining
the
amount
34


of
individual
benefit,
district
benefit,
and
community

benefit
projected
to
result
from
the
public
improvement
and
1


a
description
of
the
manner
in
which
the
cost
of
the
public
2


improvement
will
be
allocated
to
each
category
of
benefit.
3


The
bill
requires
that
30
days’
notice
of
a
resolution
4


be
published
prior
to
adoption
of
the
preliminary
resolution
5


related
to
a
public
improvement.
The
bill
requires
the
6


preliminary
resolution
to
contain
a
detailed
description
of
7


the
method
used
for
determining
benefits
as
previously
adopted
8


by
ordinance,
an
estimate
of
the
amount
of
individual
benefit,
9


district
benefit,
and
community
benefit
that
will
be
conferred
10


as
a
result
of
the
public
improvement,
and
a
statement
of
the
11


proportion
of
the
total
cost
of
the
public
improvement
which
12


the
council
proposes
to
assess
against
property
within
the
13


proposed
special
assessment
district.
14


The
bill
specifies
that
the
total
cost
of
a
public
15


improvement,
except
for
certain
paving
near
railroad
tracks
16


or
improvements
to
be
otherwise
paid,
may
be
assessed
against
17


all
lots
within
the
assessment
district
in
accordance
with
the
18


individual
benefits
conferred
upon
the
property,
and
not
in
19


excess
of
such
benefits.
The
bill
provides
that
the
portion
20


of
the
total
cost
of
a
public
improvement
that
is
not
assessed
21


to
individual
lots
as
the
result
of
individual
benefits
is
22


attributable
to
the
community
benefit
and
shall
be
paid
by
the
23


city.
24


The
bill
strikes
the
provision
of
Code
section
384.54
that
25


designated
the
cost
of
all
court
proceedings
to
be
a
legitimate
26


item
of
expense
in
connection
with
a
public
improvement
and
27


allowed
such
costs
to
be
included
within
the
final
assessment
28


against
any
property
specially
benefited
in
the
assessment
29


district.
30


The
bill
allows
a
property
owner
to
divide
property
that
31


is
subject
to
a
special
assessment
into
two
or
more
lots
for
32


the
purpose
of
separating
improved
portions
of
the
land
from
33


those
portions
of
the
land
which
are
unimproved
or
used
for
34


agricultural
purposes.
