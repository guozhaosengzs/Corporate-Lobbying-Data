EXPLANATION
17


Under
current
law,
a
motor
truck
that
qualifies
for
18


business-trade
truck
registration
fees
or
special
truck
19


registration
fees
is
issued
registration
plates
which
20


are
specially
designed
to
distinguish
the
vehicle
as
a
21


business-trade
truck
or
a
special
truck.
As
a
consequence
22


of
this
requirement,
the
owner
of
a
business-trade
truck
23


or
special
truck
for
farm
use
is
not
eligible
for
any
of
24


the
special
registration
plates
for
which
the
owner
might
25


otherwise
qualify.
This
bill
provides
the
option
of
applying
26


for
specialty
plates
for
trucks
with
business-trade
or
special
27


truck
registrations.
28


The
bill
requires
the
department
of
transportation
to
29


discontinue
the
issuance
of
business-trade
and
special
truck
30


registration
plates
with
a
distinguishing
design
on
or
before
31


January
1,
2012.
The
department
may
provide
by
rule
for
32


another
means
of
identifying
business-trade
trucks
and
special
33


trucks
for
enforcement
purposes.
34


Under
the
bill,
most
current
owners
of
trucks
which
have
35


-2-

S.F.

already
been
issued
business-trade
or
special
truck
plates
1


shall
continue
to
use
those
plates
until
ownership
transfers
or
2


the
department
of
transportation
issues
a
new
series
of
Iowa
3


registration
plates.
However,
an
owner
may
elect
to
trade
4


current
business-trade
or
special
truck
plates
for
any
of
the
5


specialty
plates
for
which
the
owner
qualifies,
subject
to
the
6


additional
fees
applicable
for
the
specialty
plates.
An
owner
7


who
applies
for
a
new
registration
of
a
business-trade
truck
or
8


special
truck
will
have
the
option
to
choose
specialty
plates
9


or
be
issued
regular
registration
plates.
10


Current
requirements
and
fees
for
business-trade
and
special
11


truck
registrations
are
not
affected
by
the
bill.
The
bill
12


is
applicable
for
plates
issued
during
registration
periods
13


beginning
on
or
after
January
1,
2012.
