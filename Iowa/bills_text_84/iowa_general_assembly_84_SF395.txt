EXPLANATION
8


Currently,
a
platted
lot
for
which
a
subdivision
plat
has
9


been
recorded
will
be
assessed
for
property
tax
purposes
as
10


acreage
or
unimproved
property
for
three
years
or
until
the
lot
11


is
actually
improved
with
permanent
construction,
whichever
12


occurs
first.
This
bill
removes
the
three-year
time
limit
and
13


provides
that
a
platted
lot
will
be
assessed
as
acreage
or
14


unimproved
property
until
the
lot
is
actually
improved
with
15


permanent
construction.
16


The
bill
also
repeals
a
provision
that
allowed
a
county
of
17


20,000
or
more
to
adopt
an
ordinance
providing
for
assessment
18


of
subdivided
lots
acquired
for
development
of
housing
in
the
19


manner
they
were
assessed
prior
to
acquisition
for
three
years
20


from
the
date
of
subdivision
or
until
the
lot
is
sold
for
21


construction
or
occupancy
of
housing,
whichever
is
sooner.
The
22


bill
also
amends
a
similar
provision
that
allowed
counties
with
23


a
population
of
less
than
20,000
to
adopt
the
same
ordinance
24


but
with
a
five-year
assessment
period,
by
removing
the
25


five-year
time
limit
and
providing
that
such
an
ordinance
may
26


allow
each
lot
to
be
taxed
in
the
manner
it
was
prior
to
its
27


acquisition
until
the
lot
is
sold
for
construction
or
occupancy
28


of
housing.
29


The
bill
applies
to
assessment
years
beginning
on
or
after
30


January
1,
2012.
