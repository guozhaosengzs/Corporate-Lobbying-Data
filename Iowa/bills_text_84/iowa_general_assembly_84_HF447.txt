EXPLANATION
20


This
bill
creates
a
state
employees’
group
whole
life
21


insurance
program
and
allocates
realized
benefits
from
the
22


program
to
the
Iowa
public
employees’
retirement
system
23


(IPERS).
24


The
bill
requires
that
the
director
of
the
department
25


of
administrative
services
administer
the
state
employees’
26


group
whole
life
insurance
program.
The
bill
requires
that
27


the
director
contract
with
a
third-party
administrator
to
28


modify
current
group
term
life
insurance
to
group
whole
life
29


insurance.
The
bill
requires
that
employee
death
benefits
30


remain
the
same,
but
that
when
an
employee
becomes
inactive
31


or
is
terminated,
the
death
benefit
shall
vest
to
IPERS.
The
32


bill
requires
that
employees
hired
after
the
date
of
enactment
33


participate
in
a
group
term
life
insurance
policy,
and
those
34


employees
have
the
right
to
continue
such
coverage
at

employee’s
own
expense
upon
the
end
of
employment
with
the
1


state.
2


The
bill
requires
that
IPERS
record
the
present
value
of
3


IPERS’
interest
in
the
employee
group
whole
life
insurance
4


program
as
an
asset.
5


The
bill
strikes
language
in
current
law
that
would
allow
6


any
employee,
current
or
future,
to
carry
the
employee’s
death
7


benefit
after
employment
if
the
former
employee
was
responsible
8


for
the
continued
expense.
The
current
law
pertained
only
to
9


group
term
life
policies.
