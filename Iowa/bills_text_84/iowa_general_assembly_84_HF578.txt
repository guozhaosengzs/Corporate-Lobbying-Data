the
28


terms
of
directors
for
all
corporations
are
for
one
year
29


(Code
section
490.805),
unless
the

The

holders
of
common
shares
and
not

11


or
the
staggered
term
requirements

opt
out
of
the
new
staggered
term
requirements
in
Code
section
14


490.806A

provision
applies
15


to

bill’s
effective
16


date.
A
public
corporation
is
automatically
exempted

staggered
term
requirements
if
it
is
already
subject
to
the
18


staggered
term
requirements
in
Code
section
490.806.
It
is
19


not
required
to
amend
its
articles
of
incorporation
or
bylaws.

A
corporation
that
becomes
a
public
corporation
on

amended
its
articles
of
incorporation
to
provide

staggered

terms
of
directors
