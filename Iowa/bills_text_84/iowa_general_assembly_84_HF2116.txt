EXPLANATION
21


Current
law
requires
a
person
who
desires
to
purchase
a
22


pistol
or
revolver
to
first
obtain
an
annual
permit
to
acquire
23


a
pistol
or
revolver
from
the
sheriff
of
the
county
where
the
24


person
resides.
An
applicant
who
is
not
otherwise
exempt
25


from
this
requirement
must
meet
certain
minimum
application
26


requirements
and
must
pass
a
criminal
history
background
check.
27


The
bill
eliminates
the
requirement
that
a
person
must
28


obtain
an
annual
permit
to
acquire
a
pistol
or
revolver,
but
29


instead
makes
it
optional
for
a
person
who
chooses
to
apply
for
30


such
a
permit,
subject
to
the
same
application
requirements.
31


The
bill
makes
a
conforming
repeal
to
Code
section
724.16,
32


relating
to
transfer
penalties.
