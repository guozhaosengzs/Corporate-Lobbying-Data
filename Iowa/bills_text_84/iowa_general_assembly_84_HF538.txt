EXPLANATION
6


This
bill
makes
changes
to
Code
chapter
357E
relating
to
7


benefited
recreational
lake
districts,
water
quality
districts,
8


and
combined
recreational
lake
and
water
quality
districts.
9


The
bill
specifies
that
districts
under
Code
chapter
357E
10


are
incorporated
as
public
entities.
11


The
bill
increases
from
three
to
seven
the
number
of
trustees
12


on
the
board
governing
a
benefited
recreational
lake
district,
13


water
quality
district,
or
combined
recreational
lake
and
14


water
quality
district,
other
than
the
two
trustees
who
may
15


be
appointed
by
the
natural
resource
commission
if
the
state
16


owns
a
certain
amount
of
land
contiguous
to
a
lake
within
the
17


district.
The
bill
makes
corresponding
changes
to
the
trustee
18


selection
procedure
for
newly
established
districts.
19


The
bill
also
provides
that
for
districts
in
existence
on
20


July
1,
2011,
the
board
of
supervisors
is
required
to
appoint
21


four
additional
trustees.
One
trustee
shall
be
appointed
to
22


serve
for
one
year,
one
for
two
years,
and
two
for
three
years.
23


Following
expiration
of
those
initial
appointments,
vacancies
24


are
filled
by
election.
25


Current
law
requires
trustees
to
be
residents
of
the
26


district.
The
bill
would
also
allow
property
owners
within
the
27


district
to
serve
as
trustees.
28


The
bill
strikes
and
replaces
Code
section
357E.11,
relating
29


to
a
district’s
authority
to
issue
bonds
in
anticipation
of
30


revenue.
New
Code
section
357E.11
authorizes
a
district
to
31


issue
bonds,
including
both
general
obligation
and
revenue
32


bonds,
in
the
same
manner
as
cities.
The
bill
provides
that
33


the
bonds
must
be
payable
at
the
place
and
be
of
the
form
34


designated
by
the
board
of
trustees.
