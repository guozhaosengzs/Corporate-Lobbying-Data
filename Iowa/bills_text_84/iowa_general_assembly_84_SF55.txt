Section
1.
Section

the

of
a
minor

may
petition
the

visitation.
6


2.
The
court
shall
consider
a
fit
parent’s
objections
7


to
granting
visitation
under
this
section.
A
rebuttable
8


presumption
arises
that
a
fit
parent’s
decision
to
deny
9


visitation
to
a
grandparent
or
great-grandparent
is
in
the
best
10


interest
of
a
minor
child.
11


3.
The
court
may
grant
visitation
to
the
grandparent
or
12


great-grandparent
if
the
court
finds
all
of
the
following
by
13


clear
and
convincing
evidence:
14


a.
The
grandparent
or
great-grandparent
has
established
a
15


substantial
relationship
with
the
child
prior
to
the
filing
of
16


the
petition.
17


b.
The
parent
who
is
being
asked
to
temporarily
relinquish
18


care,
custody,
and
control
of
the
child
to
provide
visitation
19


is
unfit
to
make
the
decision
regarding
visitation.
20


c.
It
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
to
grant
such
21


visitation.
22


4.
Notwithstanding
the
requirements
of
subsection
23


3,
the
court
may
grant
visitation
to
the
grandparent
or
24


great-grandparent
if
the
court
finds
all
of
the
following
by
25


clear
and
convincing
evidence:
26


a.
The
grandparent
or
great-grandparent
has
established
a
27


substantial
relationship
with
the
child
prior
to
the
filing
of
28


the
petition.
29


b.
The
parent
is
unable
to
provide
evidence
that
the
30


grandparent
or
great-grandparent
is
unfit
to
be
granted
31


visitation
or
that
granting
visitation
will
place
the
child
at
32


risk
of
physical
or
emotional
harm.
33


c.
The
relationship
between
the
grandparent
or
34


great-grandparent
and
the
parent
has
been
significantly

impaired
causing

such
visitation
is
in

14


EXPLANATION
15


This
bill
relates
to
granting
of
visitation
to
grandparents
16


or
great-grandparents.
The
bill
strikes
the
current
provision
17


which
limits
petitioning
for
grandparent
or
great-grandparent
18


visitation
to
grandparents
or
great-grandparents
of
a
minor
19


child
when
the
parent
of
the
minor
child,
who
is
the
child
of
20


the
grandparent
or
the
grandchild
of
the
great-grandparent,
21


is
deceased.
The
bill
replaces
the
stricken
language
with
22


the
prior
law
(Code
2009)
which
does
not
so
restrict
those
23


grandparents
or
great-grandparents
who
may
petition
the
24


court
for
visitation.
The
bill
also
adds
a
new
provision
25


that
provides,
notwithstanding
the
requirements
for
granting
26


visitation
to
a
grandparent
or
great-grandparent,
the
court
27


may
grant
such
visitation
if
the
court
finds
by
clear
and
28


convincing
evidence
that:
the
grandparent
or
great-grandparent
29


has
established
a
substantial
relationship
with
the
child
30


prior
to
the
filing
of
the
petition;
the
parent
is
unable
to
31


provide
evidence
that
the
grandparent
or
great-grandparent
is
32


unfit
to
be
granted
visitation
or
that
granting
visitation
33


will
place
the
child
at
risk
of
physical
or
emotional
harm;
34


the
relationship
between
the
grandparent
or
great-grandparent
35

and
the
parent
has
been
significantly
impaired
causing
the
1


parent
to
act
in
the
parent’s
best
interest;
and
granting
such
2


visitation
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child.
