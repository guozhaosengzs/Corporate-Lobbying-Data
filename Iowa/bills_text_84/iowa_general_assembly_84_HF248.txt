The

Criteria
shall

allow
the

designation

if
designation
or
approval
for
more
than
one
7


center
was
provided
by
both
the
division
and
the
affected
8


counties
as

October

The
criteria
shall
require
a

determination
that
all
such
centers
would
be
financially
viable
10


if
designation
is
provided
for
all.

A
period
of
time
for
counties
to
self-select
the

initial
catchment
area
affiliation
in

with

identified
criteria.
In
addition,
the
division
shall
identify
14


requirements
for
a
county
to
change
the
county’s
catchment
area

affiliation
or

from
a
different
catchment

with
an
individual
provider.

All
counties
in
the
state
shall
be
part
of
a
catchment
18


area.
The

EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
relates
to
the
requirements
of
community
mental
3


health
centers
under
Code
chapter
230A.
The
bill
is
organized
4


into
divisions.
5


CODE
CHAPTER
230A
AMENDMENTS.
This
division
repeals
and
6


replaces
Code
chapter
230A
which
was
originally
enacted
by
1974
7


Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1160.
8


The
bill
maintains
the
requirements
under
current
law
9


for
accreditation
of
community
mental
health
centers
to
be
10


performed
by
the
department
of
human
services
(DHS),
division
11


of
mental
health
and
disability
services,
in
accordance
12


with
standards
adopted
by
the
mental
health
and
disability
13


services
commission.
2008
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
1187,
required
14


the
division
to
utilize
an
advisory
group
to
develop
a
15


proposal
for
revising
Code
chapter
230A
and
for
revising
the
16


accreditation
process
for
centers.
Until
the
proposal
has
been
17


considered
and
acted
upon
by
the
general
assembly,
the
division
18


administrator
is
authorized
to
defer
consideration
of
requests
19


for
accreditation
of
a
new
community
mental
health
center
or
20


for
approval
of
a
provider
to
fill
the
role
of
a
center.
The
21


proposal
was
submitted
to
the
governor
and
general
assembly
22


April
17,
2009.
The
bill
provides
for
implementation
of
the
23


proposal.
24


The
current
Code
chapter
provides
for
community
mental
25


health
centers
to
either
be
directly
established
by
a
county
26


or
counties
and
administered
by
a
board
of
trustees
or
by
27


establishment
of
a
nonprofit
corporation
operating
on
the
basis
28


of
an
agreement
with
a
county
or
counties.
Code
section
225C.7
29


allows
the
department
of
human
services
to
authorize
the
center
30


services
to
be
provided
by
an
alternative
provider.
31


The
bill
replaces
this
approach
by
requiring
the
division
32


and
commission
to
consult
with
affected
counties
in
identifying
33


catchment
areas
of
counties
to
be
served
by
a
center.
The
34


general
requirement
is
for
one
center
to
be
designated
to

a

but
more
than
one
can
be
designated
if
1


exceptional
circumstances
outlined
in
the
bill
are
determined
2


to
exist.
3


New
Code
section
230A.101
describes
the
regulatory
and
4


policy
role
to
be
filled
by
the
department
and
the
service
5


provider
role
of
the
community
mental
health
centers.
6


New
Code
section
230A.102
provides
definitions.
These
7


terms,
defined
in
Code
chapter
225C,
are
adopted
by
reference:
8


“administrator”
(administrator
of
MH
and
disability
services
9


division),
“commission”
(mental
health
and
disability
services
10


commission),
“department”
(DHS),
“disability
services”
11


(services
and
other
support
available
to
a
person
with
mental
12


illness,
MR
or
other
developmental
disability
or
brain
injury),
13


and
“division”
(MH
and
disability
services
division).
In
14


addition,
the
terms
“community
mental
health
center”
and
15


“catchment
area”
are
defined
to
reflect
the
contents
of
the
16


bill.
17


New
Code
section
230A.103
provides
criteria
to
be
18


implemented
by
the
division
for
designation
of
at
least
one
19


community
mental
health
center
to
serve
a
catchment
area
20


consisting
of
a
county
or
counties.
Various
operating
and
21


services
requirements
are
to
be
addressed
in
the
terms
of
an
22


agreement
between
the
designated
center,
the
division,
and
the
23


counties
comprising
the
catchment
area.
24


New
Code
section
230A.104
provides
for
the
division
to
25


implement
objective
criteria
for
identifying
catchment
areas
26


for
centers.
A
general
limitation
of
one
center
per
catchment
27


area
is
stated,
however,
the
criteria
are
to
include
a
formal
28


review
process
for
use
in
determining
whether
exceptional
29


circumstances
exist
for
designating
more
than
one
center
30


for
a
catchment
area.
The
other
stated
criteria
involve
31


determinations
of
financial
viability
for
a
center
to
operate.
32


New
Code
section
230A.105
lists
the
attributes
of
the
33


target
population
required
to
be
served
by
a
center.
The
34


list
includes
individuals
of
any
age
experiencing
a

8


health
and
safety
needs
of
the
target
population
and
other
9


residents
of
the
catchment
area.
The
core
services
are

10


identified

18


associated
services
provided
by
other
unaffiliated
agencies
to
19


members
of
the
target
population
and

in
residential
or
inpatient
21


settings.
22


New
Code
section
230A.107
requires
a
designated
center

23


organized

This
section
also
states

8


substantial

is
directed
to
use
an
advisory
committee
to
assist

10


standards
development.

are
required
to
include
