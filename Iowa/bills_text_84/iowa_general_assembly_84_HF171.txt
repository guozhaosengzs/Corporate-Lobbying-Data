H.F.
171


(e)
(i)
Beginning
July
1,
2011,
the
policy
shall
allow
1


a
director
of
an
executive
branch
agency
who
believes
that


2


the
agency
will
not
be
able
to
reach
the
applicable
target
3


aggregate
ratio
to
apply
for
a
waiver
of
that
requirement
4


through
a
five-person
review
board.
In
applying
for
a
waiver,
5


the
director
shall
provide
detailed
documentation
to
the
board


6


describing
the
efforts
that
the
executive
branch
agency
has


7


made
in
attempting
to
meet
the
applicable
target
aggregate
8


ratio
provided
in
this
paragraph
“g”
.
The
review
board
shall
9


consist
of
the
director
of
the
department
of
management
or
10


a
designee
of
the
director,
three
agency
directors
or
the
11


designees
of
those
directors
as
designated
by
the
governor,
12


and
one
public
member
selected
by
the
employee
organization
13


representing
the
greatest
number
of
executive
branch
employees.
14


However,
if
a
department
represented
on
the
review
board
seeks
15


a
waiver,
the
member
representing
the
department
shall
not
16


participate
in
the
decision
on
whether
to
grant
a
waiver
for


17


that
department.
18


(ii)
Prior
to
determining
whether
to
grant
a
waiver,
the
19


review
board
shall
make
an
initial
determination
of
whether
the
20


executive
branch
agency
has
provided
sufficient
information


21


to
conduct
a
review.
If
not,
the
review
board
shall
deny


22


the
request
and
notify
the
executive
branch
agency
of
the
23


information
needed
to
consider
the
request
for
waiver.
If
a
24


waiver
is
granted,
the
review
board
shall
limit
the
waiver
to


25


only
those
operations
within
an
executive
branch
agency
in


26


which
adequate
justification
for
granting
a
waiver
has
been
27


established.
28


(f)
The
policy
shall
provide
that
if
layoffs
are
29


implemented,
the
number
of
middle
management
position
layoffs
30


shall
correspond
to
the
relative
number
of
direct
service


31


position
layoffs.


32


(g)


The
policy
shall
improve
on
the
system
in
effect
as
33


of
the
base
date
by
specifically
defining
and
accounting
for


34


supervisory
employee
span
of
control.
