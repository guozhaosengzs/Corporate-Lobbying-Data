of
the

The

by
the

To
meet
the
department’s
cash
flow
needs,
the
department
28


may
temporarily
use
funds
from
the
general
fund
of
the
state
29


to
pay
expenses
in
excess
of
moneys
available
in
the
revolving
30


fund
if
those
additional
expenditures
are
fully
reimbursable

and
the
department
reimburses
the

the
contrary,

the

is
minimized
to
the
lowest
extent
possible.

Periodic

shall
be
deemed

to

requirement.
Because
any

used
shall
be

fully
reimbursed,
such
temporary
use
of
funds
from
the
general

Except

for

the
office
of

and
the
3


banking
division,
the

and
the

shall
be

paid
from

The

shall
work

to

12


and
the
legislative
services
agency
on
revenues
billed

To

for
the
office
of

17


advocate
and
the
banking
division,
credit
union
division,
18


utilities
division,
or
the
insurance
division
of
the
19


department,
the
administrative
head
of
that
division
or
20


office
may
temporarily
use
funds
from
the
general
fund
of
the
21


state
to
pay
expenses
in
excess
of
moneys
available
in
the
22


revolving
fund
for
that
division
or
office
if
those
additional
23


expenditures
are
fully
reimbursable
and
the
division
or
office
24


reimburses
the
general
fund
of
the
state
and
ensures
all
25


moneys
are
repaid
in
full
by
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year.
26


Notwithstanding
any
provision
to
the
contrary,
the
divisions


27


shall,
to
the
fullest
extent
possible,
make
an
estimate
28


of
billings
and
make
such
billings
as
early
as
possible
in

year,
so
that
the
need
for

moneys
is
minimized
to
the
lowest
extent
possible.


31


Periodic

shall
be
deemed
sufficient
to
satisfy
this


32


requirement.


Because
any
general
fund
moneys
used
shall
be
33


fully
reimbursed,
such
temporary
use
of
funds
from
the
general
34
