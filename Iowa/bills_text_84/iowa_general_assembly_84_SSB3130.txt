for
charges
for
administrative
31

2


the
court-approved

be

is
not
subject
to
a
court’s
determination
of
5


the
prisoner’s
reasonable

6


Current
law
provides
the
court
must
make
a
determination
7


of
an
offender’s
reasonable
ability
to
pay
in
a
criminal
case
8


prior
to
entering
a

fees,
contributions
to
a

12


anticrime
organization,
and
restitution
to
the
medical

The
bill
eliminates
the
requirement
for
14


a
court
to
make
a
determination
of

offender’s
reasonable
15


ability
to
pay
except
for
court-appointed
attorney
fees
ordered

pursuant

Code
section
815.9.
17


Under
current
law,
when
a
court
makes
a
determination
an
18


offender
is
not
reasonably
able
to
pay,
the
court
may
require
19


the
offender
to
perform
public
service
in
lieu
of
payment
20


for
crime
victim
compensation
program
costs,
public
agency
21

court
costs,
court-appointed
attorney
fees,

contributions
to
a

restitution.
Under
the
bill,
a
court
may
24


only
require
the
offender
to
perform
public
service
in
lieu
of
25


payment
for
court-appointed
attorney
fees
ordered
pursuant
to
26


Code
section
815.9.


27


Under
current
law,
if
the
full
amount
of
restitution
cannot
28


be
determined
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
the
court
is
required
29


to

a
temporary
order
determining
a
reasonable
amount
30


for
restitution
identified
at
that
time,
and
shall
issue
a


31


permanent,
supplemental
order
determining
the
full
amount
of
32


restitution
at
a
later
date.
The
bill
strikes
this
provision.
