Under

another

If

is
unlawful
or
unsafe,
the
21


driver
is
required
to
slow
the
motor

proper
speed
for

below

24


This
bill
provides
that
the
driver
of
a
towing
or
recovery
25


vehicle
who
observes
a
motor
vehicle
failing
to
move
over
or
26


slow
down
when
approaching
the
towing
or
recovery
vehicle
27


may
make
a
written
report
to
a
peace
officer
of
the
state
or
28

the
county
or
municipality
where
the
violation
occurred,
29


stating
the
time
and
location
of
the
violation,

72
hours
of
the
alleged
33


violation.
The

initiate
an

34


within
seven
days

involved
in
the
reported
violation,
requesting
that
the
owner
1


identify
the
driver
involved
in
the
violation.
If
the
peace
2


officer
has
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
a
violation
3


occurred
and
learns
the
identity
of
the
driver
involved
in
4


the
violation,
the
peace
officer
may
issue
a
citation
to
the
5


driver,
either
in
person
or
by
certified
mail.
6


The
bill
provides
that
if
the
identity
of
the
driver
involved
7


in
the
violation
cannot
be
determined,
the
peace
officer
8


investigating
the
report
may
issue
a
citation
to
the
owner
9


of
the
vehicle.
In
a
proceeding
where
the
peace
officer
was
10


not
able
to
identify
the
driver
of
the
vehicle,
proof
that
11


the
vehicle
described
in
the
citation
was
used
to
commit
12


the
violation,
together
with
proof
that
the
person
named
in
13


the
citation
was
the
registered
owner
of
the
vehicle
at
the
14


time
the
violation
occurred,
creates
a
permissible
inference
15


that
the
registered
owner
was
the
driver
who
committed
the
16


violation.
