HOUSE
JOINT
RESOLUTION


A
Joint
Resolution
requesting
the
Congress
of
the
United
States
1


to
call
a
constitutional
convention
pursuant
to
Article
V
of
2


the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
in
order
to
propose
3


an
amendment
to
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
4


permitting
the
repeal
of
any
federal
law
or
regulation
by
a
5


vote
of
two-thirds
of
state
legislatures.
6


WHEREAS,
Article
I
of
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
7


begins
“All
legislative
powers
herein
granted
shall
be
vested
8


in
a
Congress
of
the
United
States”;
and
9


WHEREAS,
the
Congress
has
exceeded
the
legislative
powers
10


granted
in
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
as
described
11


in
this
Resolution,
thereby
encroaching
on
the
powers
that
are
12


“reserved
to
the
states
respectively,
or
to
the
people”
as
the
13


Tenth
Amendment
affirms
and
the
rights
“retained
by
the
people”
14


to
which
the
Ninth
Amendment
refers;
and
15


WHEREAS,
this
encroachment
includes
the
accumulation
of
16


federal
debt,
which
combined
with
interest
represents
a
future
17


tax,
and
is
of
such
great
proportion
that
responsibility
for
18


its
payments
will
be
passed
to
future,
unborn
generations
of
19


Americans
to
assume
without
their
consent,
thereby
disparaging
20


their
rights;
and
21


WHEREAS,
this
encroachment
also
includes
compelling
22


state
and
local
governments
to
comply
with
federal
laws
and
23


regulations
without
accompanying
funding
for
such
mandates;
and
24


WHEREAS,
in
Federalist
No.
85,
Alexander
Hamilton
wrote
in
25


reference
to
Article
V
of
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
26


and
the
calling
of
a
convention
for
the
purpose
of
proposing

amendments
that,
“We
may
safely
rely
on
the
disposition
of
the
28


State
legislatures
to
erect
barriers
against
the
encroachments
29


of
national
authority”;
and
30


WHEREAS,
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
should
be
31


amended
in
order
to
halt
federal
encroachment
and
restore
a
32


proper
balance
between
the
powers
of
Congress
and
those
of
the
33


several
states,
and
to
prevent
the
denial
or
disparagement
of
34


the
rights
retained
by
the
people;
NOW
THEREFORE,
35


BE
IT
RESOLVED
BY

EXPLANATION
1


This
joint
resolution
constitutes
an
application
to
the
2


Congress
of
the
United
States
from
the
State
of
Iowa
through
3


the
Iowa
General
Assembly,
as
required
by
Article
V
of
the
4


Constitution
of
the
United
States,
calling
upon
Congress
5


to
convene
a
constitutional
convention
for
the
purpose
of
6


considering
a
United
States
constitutional
amendment
to
allow
7


the
several
states
to
repeal
any
federal
law
or
regulation
by
8


approval
of
two-thirds
of
the
state
legislatures.
9


The
resolution
stipulates
the
retroactive
withdrawal
of
this
10


application
should
a
convention
be
summoned
for
any
purpose
11


other
than
for
the
proposed
amendment.
12


Similar
resolutions
would
need
to
be
approved
by
two-thirds
13


of
the
states
for
the
constitutional
convention
to
be
called
14


to
propose
the
United
States
constitutional
amendment
set
out
15


in
this
resolution.
Three-fourths
of
the
states
would
need
to
16


ratify
the
constitutional
amendment
for
the
amendment
to
become
17


part
of
the
United
States
Constitution.
