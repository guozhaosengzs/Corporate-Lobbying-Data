EXPLANATION

This
bill
authorizes
the
establishment
of
health
insurance
30


exchanges
in
the
state.
31


The
bill
creates
new
Code
chapter
514M,
which
authorizes
the
32


establishment
of
health
insurance
exchanges
in
the
state
to
33


facilitate
the
purchase
and
sale
of
qualified
health
benefit
34


plans
in
the
individual
market
in
this
state
and

assist

qualified
small
employers
in
facilitating
the
availability
1


of
qualified
health
benefit
plans
offered
in
the
small
group
2


market.
The
intent
of
establishing
of
such
exchanges
is
3


to
reduce
the
number
of
uninsured,
provide
a
transparent
4


marketplace
and
consumer
education,
and
assist
individuals
5


with
access
to
programs,
premium
assistance
tax
credits,
and
6


cost-sharing
reductions.
7


A
health
insurance
exchange
shall
be
established
in
the
8


state,
and
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
commissioner
of
9


insurance,
may
be
operated
by
the
insurance
division
of
the
10


department
of
commerce
or
as
a
nonprofit
corporation
approved
11


by
the
commissioner.
The
commissioner
is
required
to
approve
12


the
establishment
of
one
or
more
exchanges
in
the
state
that
13


meet
the
requirements
of
new
Code
chapter
514M.
An
exchange
14


or
components
of
an
exchange
may
be
operated
on
a
statewide
15


or
regional
basis,
or
on
a
multistate
basis,
subject
to
the
16


approval
of
the
commissioner.
Such
an
exchange
shall
be
17


operated
pursuant
to
a
plan
of
operation
approved
by
the
18


commissioner.
19


All
persons
who
enroll
in
a
qualified
health
benefit
plan
20


offered
through
an
exchange
must
be
enrolled
by
an
insurance
21


producer
who
is
licensed
as
provided
in
Code
chapter
522B.
The
22


health
carrier
that
issues
the
qualified
health
benefit
plan
23


selected
must
pay
the
insurance
producer
a
commission
of
at
24


least
5
percent
of
the
premium
paid
by
the
enrollee.
If
a
25


health
carrier
offers
health
benefit
plans
outside
an
exchange,
26


the
health
carrier
must
also
pay
the
producer
involved
in
the
27


sale
a
commission
of
at
least
5
percent
of
the
premium
paid
by
28


the
enrollee.
29


An
exchange
may
contract
with
an
eligible
entity
to
30


fulfill
any
of
its
responsibilities
as
described
in
new
Code
31


chapter
514M.
An
eligible
entity
includes
an
entity
with
32


experience
in
individual
and
small
group
health
benefit
plans,
33


benefit
administration,
or
other
experience
relevant
to
the
34


responsibilities

An
exchange
may
1


also
enter
into
information-sharing
agreements
with
federal
2


and
state
agencies
and
other
state
exchanges
if
there
are
3


adequate
protections
with
respect
to
the
confidentiality
of
the
4


information
to
be
shared.
5


An
exchange
established
or
approved
pursuant
to
Code
section
6


514M.4
is
required
to
make
qualified
health
benefit
plans
7


that
are
effective
on
or
before
January
1,
2014,
available
8


to
qualified
individuals
and
qualified
employers.
Such
an
9


exchange
is
also
required
to
request
a
five-year
waiver
from
10


the
secretary
of
the
United
States
department
of
health
and
11


human
services
of
the
certification
requirements
for
health
12


benefit
plans
of
the
federal
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
13


Care
Act
(PPACA),
to
enable
the
exchange
to
offer
mandate-free
14


health
benefit
plans
that
are
exempt
from
some
or
all
of
15


the
special
health
and
accident
insurance
coverages
required
16


pursuant
to
the
federal
Act
or
Code
chapter
514C.
17


An
exchange
or
a
health
carrier
offering
qualified
health
18


benefit
plans
through
the
exchange
cannot
charge
an
individual
19


a
fee
or
penalty
for
termination
of
coverage
if
the
individual
20


enrolls
in
another
type
of
minimum
essential
coverage
because
21


the
individual
is
newly
eligible
for
that
coverage
or
because
22


the
individual’s
employer-sponsored
coverage
has
become
23


affordable.
24


The
bill
specifies
the
duties
of
an
exchange
to
carry
out
25


the
intent
of
the
Code
chapter
consistent
with
the
PPACA
and
26


state
law.
The
bill
authorizes
an
exchange
to
select
entities
27


to
serve
as
navigators
and
to
award
grants
to
enable
navigators
28


to
conduct
public
education
activities;
distribute
fair
and
29


impartial
information
concerning
enrollment
in
qualified
health
30


benefit
plans
including
the
availability
of
premium
tax
credits
31


and
cost-sharing
reductions;
facilitate
enrollment
through
an
32


insurance
producer
in
health
benefit
plans
through
or
outside
33


the
exchange;
provide
referrals
to
the
federal

of

Entities
qualified

navigators
that

3


must
be

producers
or

All
5


entities
that
provide
facilitation
for
a

shall
be

7


An
exchange
is
given
parameters
for
certifying
health
8


benefit
plans
as
qualified
health
benefit
plans.
Under
the
9


PPACA,
only
qualified
health
benefit
plans
can
be
sold
through
10


an
exchange
and
a
health
benefit
plan
must
be
certified
as

meeting
certain
minimum
standards
specified
in
the
PPACA
12


and
in

Code
chapter
514M
to
be
certified
as
a

Also,
a
health
carrier
must
meet
certain
14


standards
in
order
to
have
its
plans
certified
so
that
the
15


plans
can
be
offered
through
an
exchange.
16


An
exchange
is
authorized
to
charge
assessments
or
user
fees
17


to
health
carriers
that
offer
health
benefit
plans
through
18

An

and
any
other

required
by
the

and
the

administrative
costs
of
the
exchange
on

educate
consumers
about

The

to
adopt
