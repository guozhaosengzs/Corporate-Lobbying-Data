This

value.
There
are
two

the
owner
33


must
be

eligible
corporate
entity.

1


OWNERSHIP.
The
bill
increases
the
number
of
eligible
2


corporate
entities
entitled
to
claim
the
tax
credit.
Currently
3


the
tax
credit
can
be
claimed
by
a
family
farm
corporation
or
4


an
authorized
farm
corporation
which
are
both
exempt
from
the
5


provisions
of
Code
chapter
9H,
prohibiting
corporate
entities
6


from
holding
agricultural
land.
7


CONDITIONS.
The
bill
provides
that
a
family
farm
limited
8


liability
company
must
comply
with
the
same
conditions
as
a
9


family
farm
corporation.
It
must
be
founded
for
the
purpose
10


of
farming
and
the
ownership
of
agricultural
land;
a
majority
11


of
the
members
must
be
related;
all
the
members
must
be
12


individuals,
or
acting
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
for
individuals;
13


and
60
percent
of
its
gross
revenues
over
the
last
three
years
14


must
come
from
farming.
An
authorized
limited
liability
15


company
must
comply
with
the
same
conditions
as
an
authorized
16


farm
corporation.
It
also
must
be
founded
for
the
purpose
of
17


farming
and
the
ownership
of
agricultural
land;
there
cannot
be
18


more
than
25
members
who
must
be
individuals
or
persons
acting
19


in
a
fiduciary
capacity
for
individuals;
and
it
cannot
hold
20


more
than
1,500
acres
of
agricultural
land.
21


RESTRICTION
ON
LEASES.
Code
chapter
425A
provides
that
an
22


owner
cannot
qualify
for
the
tax
credit
if
the
owner
leases
23


the
agricultural
land
to
another
person.
One
exception
24


applies
when
the
owner
is
also
a
shareholder
of
a
family
farm
25


corporation
and
leases
the
land
to
that
entity.
The
bill
26


provides
that
the
same
exception
applies
to
an
owner
who
is
27


also
a
member
of
a
family
farm
limited
liability
company.
The
28


owner
leasing
the
agricultural
land
to
a
family
farm
limited
29


liability
company
cannot
qualify
for
the
tax
credit,
unless
a
30


designated
person
is
actually
farming
the
agricultural
land,
31


and
51
percent
or
more
of
the
total
membership
interest
in
the
32


family
farm
limited
liability
company
is
held
by
the
owner
or
33


the
owner’s
relatives.
