This
bill
provides
for
the
registration
of
certain
29


all-terrain

Under
the
bill,
all-terrain

with

or
more
31


wheels
and
a
combustion
engine
having
a
piston
or
rotor
32


displacement
of
200
centimeters
or
more
may
be
titled
and
33


registered
with
the
department
of
transportation
for
operation
34


on
streets
or
highways.
The
annual
registration
fee
is
$20.

The
provision
applies
to
off-road
utility
vehicles,
which
for
1


purposes
of
motor
vehicle
regulation,
are
included
in
the
2


definition
of
“all-terrain
vehicle”.
Because
all-terrain
3


vehicles
are
currently
subject
to
sales
tax,
the
bill
provides
4


that
the
vehicles
are
exempt
from
the
fee
for
new
registration
5


imposed
on
vehicles
subject
to
registration,
so
long
as
the
6


owner
has
paid
the
required
sales
tax
at
the
time
of
purchase.
7


The
bill
states
that
a
person
must
have
a
valid
driver’s
8


license
to
operate
a
registered
all-terrain
vehicle
on
a
9


highway
and
that
motor
vehicle
laws
apply
to
the
operation
of
10


registered
all-terrain
vehicles
except
provisions
relating
to
11


required
equipment
which
by
their
nature
can
have
no
practical
12


application.
The
bill
requires
a
registered
all-terrain
13


vehicle
operated
on
a
highway
to
be
equipped
with
headlights,
14


taillights,
turn
signals,
a
rearview
mirror,
and
safety
15


belts.
A
registered
all-terrain
vehicle
may
not
be
driven
on
16


an
interstate.
A
violation
of
these
provisions
is
a
simple
17


misdemeanor,
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$50.
18


Pursuant
to
Code
section
321.234A,
all-terrain
vehicles
are
19


currently
permitted
on
highways
for
limited
purposes,
including
20


agricultural
use,
subject
to
specific
restrictions.
Those
21


existing
provisions
are
not
amended
in
the
bill
and
continue
to
22


apply
to
all-terrain
vehicles
which
are
not
registered
by
the
23


department
of
transportation
under
the
bill.
24


Under
current
law,
all-terrain
vehicles
operated
on
public
25


land
or
ice
or
on
designated
riding
areas
or
designated
riding
26


trails
are
required
to
be
registered
with
the
department
27


of
natural
resources.
All-terrain
vehicles
acquired
after
28


January
1,
2000,
other
than
those
used
exclusively
as
farm
29


implements,
must
also
be
titled
by
the
department.
The
bill
30


provides
an
exception
to
that
titling
requirement
for
an
31


all-terrain
vehicle
titled
and
registered
with
the
department
32


of
transportation.
However,
under
the
bill,
an
all-terrain
33


vehicle
which
is
titled
and
registered
for
highway
operation
34


must
still
be
registered

for

of
