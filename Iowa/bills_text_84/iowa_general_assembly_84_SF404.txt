Findings
and
intent.
1


1.
The
general
assembly
finds
all
of
the
following:
2


a.
Technology
used
to
support
health-related
functions
is
3


widely
known
as
health
information
technology.
Electronic
4


health
records
are
used
to
collect
and
store
relevant
patient
5


health
information.
Electronic
health
records
serve
as
a
means
6


of
bringing
evidence-based
knowledge
resources
and
patient
7


information
to
the
point
of
care
to
support
better
decision
8


making
and
more
efficient
care
processes.
9


b.
Health
information
technology
allows
for
comprehensive
10


management
of
health
information
and
its
secure
electronic
11


exchange
between
providers,
public
health
agencies,
payers,
12


and
consumers.
Broad
use
of
health
information
technology
13


should
improve
health
care
quality
and
the
overall
health
of
14


the
population,
increase
efficiencies
in
administrative
health
15


care,
reduce
unnecessary
health
care
costs,
and
help
prevent
16


medical
errors.
17


c.
Health
information
technology
provides
a
mechanism
to
18


transform
the
delivery
of
health
and
medical
care
in
Iowa
and
19


across
the
nation.
20


2.
It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
use
health
21


information
technology
as
a
catalyst
to
achieve
a
healthier
22


Iowa
through
the
electronic
sharing
of
health
information.
A
23


health
information
exchange
involves
sharing
health
information
24


across
the
boundaries
of
individual
practice
and
institutional
25


health
settings
and
with
consumers.
The
result
is
a
public
26


good
that
will
contribute
to
improved
clinical
outcomes
and
27


patient
safety,
population
health,
access
to
and
quality
of
28


health
care,
and
efficiency
in
health
care
delivery.
