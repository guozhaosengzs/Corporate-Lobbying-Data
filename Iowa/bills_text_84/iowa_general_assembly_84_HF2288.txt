district’s
or
agency’s
administration.
The
administrator
1


members
shall
be
appointed
by
the
school

However,
if
a
2


school
district
can
demonstrate
that
an
existing
professional

development,
curriculum,
or
student
improvement
committee
has
4


significant
stakeholder
involvement
and
a
leadership
role
in
5


the
school

the
appointing
authorities
may
mutually
6


agree
to
assign
to
the
existing

the
responsibilities
7


set
forth
in
this
paragraph

,
to
appoint
members
of
the
8


existing

authorize
the
existing

to
serve
in
an
advisory
10


capacity
to
the
teacher
quality
committee.
The
committee
shall

The

which

24


meets
multiple
standards
and
criteria.

or
section
15

directors
in

accordance
with
this
subparagraph
is
final.


17


EXPLANATION
18


This
bill
provides
options
to
requirements
established
under
19


the
student
achievement
and
teacher
quality
program
for
the
20


use
and
distribution
of
teacher
salary
funds
calculated
and
21


paid
to
a
school
district
or
area
education
agency
through
the
22


categorical
professional
development
supplement
of
the
state
23


school
foundation
program.
24


Currently,
the
program
requires
distribution
of
teacher
25


salary
funds
to
be
determined
by
negotiations
between
26


the
school
or
agency
board
of
directors
and
the
certified
27


bargaining
representative
for
the
licensed
employees
if
the
28


employees
are
organized
for
collective
bargaining
purposes.
29


If
the
employees
are
not
organized
for
collective
bargaining
30


purposes,
the
board
of
directors
determines
the
method
of
31


distribution.
32


Under
the
bill,
the
board
of
directors
may
negotiate
the
33


distribution
of
the
teacher
salary
funds
with
the
certified
34


bargaining
representative
for
the
licensed
employees,
but

H.F.

if
the
parties
fail
to
reach
an
agreement,
the
board
shall
1


determine
the
method
of
distribution
of
such
funds
based
upon
2


the
student
achievement
needs
of
the
school
district.
3


Currently,
school
districts
and
area
education
agencies
4


are
required
to
create
a
teacher
quality
committee,
which
is
5


charged
with,
among
other
duties,
determining
the
use
and
6


distribution
of
the
professional
development
funds
based
upon
7


school
district
or
agency,
attendance
center,
and
individual
8


teacher
and
professional
development
plans.
9


The
bill
provides
that
the
school
district
or
agency
10


must
create
the
committee
only
if
both
a
majority
of
the
11


administrators
and
a
majority
of
the
teachers
employed
by
the
12


district
or
agency
approve
of
the
committee’s
creation.
If
a
13


committee
is
not
created,
the
bill
provides
that
the
school
14


district
or
agency
board
of
directors
must
collaborate
with
the
15


certified
employee
organization,
if
one
exists,
to
determine
16


the
use
and
distribution
of
professional
development
funds
17


based
upon
the
school
district
or
agency,
attendance
center,
18


and
individual
teacher
and
professional
development
plans,
but
19


a
decision
on
the
use
and
distribution
of
the
funds
rendered
by
20


a
board
of
directors
is
final.
21


The
bill
eliminates
an
obsolete
provision
and
makes
22


conforming
changes.
