EXPLANATION
6


GENERAL.
This
bill
relates
to
agriculture
and
specifically
7


the
authority
of
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
8


stewardship
(DALS)
to
administer
and
enforce
a
number
of
9


statutory
provisions.
10


DIVISION
I
——
ORGANIC
NUTRIENT
MANAGEMENT.
The
bill
11


eliminates
the
organic
nutrient
management
fund
(Code
section
12


161C.5)
used
to
support
the
organic
nutrient
management
13


program
(Code
section
161C.6),
which
the
bill
also
eliminates.
14


The
fund
and
the
program
are
administered
by
DALS’
soil
15


conservation
division.
The
purpose
of
the
fund
and
program
16


is
to
provide
financial
incentives
to
establish
livestock
17


manure
management
systems
in
order
to
facilitate
the
proper
18


utilization
of
livestock
manure,
and
to
protect
the
water
19


resources
of
the
state
from
livestock
manure
runoff.
The
fund
20


has
a
balance
of
less
than
$20,
which
is
to
be
retained
by
the
21


division.
22


DIVISION
II
——
CONTROL
OF
PATHOGENIC
VIRUSES
IN
POULTRY.
23


The
bill
eliminates
provisions
in
Code
section
165B.2
which
24


authorize
DALS
to
regulate
certain
viruses
affecting
poultry,
25


including
avian
paramyxovirus,
commonly
referred
to
as
26


Newcastle
disease,
and
avian
influenza
(defined
as
pathogenic
27


viruses).
Specifically,
the
bill
eliminates
a
provision
which
28


authorizes
DALS
to
adopt
rules
for
the
establishment
of
civil
29


penalties
which
may
be
administratively
or
judicially
assessed.
30


The
bill
does
not
amend
other
statutory
provisions
which
31


provide
DALS
with
similar
authority
to
regulate
the
prevention
32


and
control
of
pathogenic
viruses.
DALS
may
adopt
rules
for
33


civil
penalties
under
Code
chapter
163
which
may
also
be
34


administratively
or
judicially
assessed
(Code
section
163.61),

and
may
continue
to
provide
civil
penalties
for
certain
1


violations
of
Code
chapter
165B
(Code
sections
165B.4
and
2


165B.5).
3


DIVISION
III
——
BULK
DRY
ANIMAL
NUTRIENT
PRODUCTS.
The
bill
4


eliminates
a
provision
in
Code
chapter
200A
which
provides
for
5


the
regulation
of
bulk
dry
animal
nutrient
(manure)
products.
6


Specifically,
the
eliminated
provision
allows
DALS
to
enter
7


onto
public
or
private
premises
in
order
to
conduct
laboratory
8


examinations
to
determine
if
such
products
comply
with
the
Code
9


chapter’s
standards
(Code
section
200A.10(3)).
10


DIVISION
IV
——
AGRICULTURAL
REMEDIATION.
The
bill
11


eliminates
Code
chapter
161
providing
for
agrichemical
12


remediation.
An
“agrichemical”
is
defined
as
a
fertilizer
13


or
pesticide
(Code
section
161.2).
The
Code
chapter
is
14


administered
by
an
agrichemical
remediation
board
(Code
15


section
161.3)
which
is
responsible
for
executing
remediation
16


agreements
with
persons
and
carrying
out
a
plan
to
remediate
17


a
contaminated
site
(Code
section
161.8).
The
board
is
18


also
responsible
for
the
payment
of
claims
associated
with
19


remediation
costs
(Code
section
161.9).
The
payment
of
claims
20


is
supported
by
available
moneys
in
an
agricultural
remediation
21


fund.
In
2009,
Senate
File
467
(2009
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
175,
22


section
4)
appropriated
all
unobligated
or
unencumbered
moneys
23


from
the
fund
to
support
DALS.
The
bill
requires
the
executive
24


council
to
satisfy
any
outstanding
claims
against
the
fund.
25


DIVISION
V
——
SWINE
DEALER
LICENSING
——
IDENTIFICATION
CARD.
26


The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
that
requires
persons
employed
27


or
acting
on
behalf
of
a
licensed
feeder
swine
dealer
to
obtain
28


an
identification
card
issued
by
the
department.
