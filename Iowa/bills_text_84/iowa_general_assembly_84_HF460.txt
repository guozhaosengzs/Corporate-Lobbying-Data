NEW
SUBSECTION
.
3A.
a.
Except
as
otherwise
provided
in
14


this
subsection,
the
confidentiality
privilege
under
this
15


section
shall
be
absolute
with
regard
to
a
criminal
action
and
16


this
section
shall
not
be
construed
to
authorize
or
require
17


the
disclosure
of
any
privileged
records
to
a
defendant
in
a
18


criminal
action
unless
either
of
the
following
occur:
19


(1)
The
privilege
holder
voluntarily
waives
the
20


confidentiality
privilege.
21


(2)
(a)
The
defendant
seeking
access
to
privileged
records
22


under
this
section
files
a
motion
demonstrating
in
good
faith
a
23


reasonable
probability
that
the
information
sought
is
likely
24


to
contain
exculpatory
information
that
is
not
available
from
25


any
other
source
and
for
which
there
is
a
compelling
need
for
26


the
defendant
to
present
a
defense
in
the
case.
Such
a
motion
27


shall
be
filed
not
later

after
arraignment
28


under
seal
of
the
court.
Failure
of
the
defendant
to
timely
29


file
such
a
motion
constitutes
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
seek
30


access
to
privileged
records
under
this
section,
but
the
court,
31


for
good
cause
shown,
may
grant
relief
from
such
waiver.
32


(b)
Upon
a
showing
of
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
33


privileged
records
sought
may
likely
contain
exculpatory
34


information
that
is
not
available
from
any
other
source,

court
shall
conduct
an
in
camera
review
of
such
records
to
1


determine
whether
exculpatory
information
is
contained
in
such
2


records.
3


(c)
If
exculpatory
information
is
contained
in
such
4


records,
the
court
shall
balance
the
need
to
disclose
such
5


information
against
the
privacy
interest
of
the
privilege
6


holder.
7


(d)
Upon
the
court’s
determination,
in
writing,
that
the
8


privileged
information
sought
is
exculpatory
and
that
there
9


is
a
compelling
need
for
such
information
that
outweighs
the
10


privacy
interests
of
the
privilege
holder,
the
court
shall
11


issue
an
order
allowing
the
disclosure
of
only
those
portions
12


of
the
records
that
contain
the
exculpatory
information.
The
13


court’s
order
shall
also
prohibit
any
further
dissemination
14


of
the
information
to
any
person,
other
than
the
defendant,
15


the
defendant’s
attorney,
and
the
prosecutor,
unless
otherwise
16


authorized
by
the
court.
17


b.
Privileged
information
obtained
by
any
means
other
than
18


as
provided
in
paragraph
“a”
shall
not
be
admissible
in
any
19


criminal
action.

Sec.

EFFECTIVE
UPON
ENACTMENT.
This
Act,
being
deemed
of

22


EXPLANATION
23


This
bill
relates
to
the
discovery
of
privileged
medical
24


records,
including
mental
health
records,
in
a
criminal
case
25


and
includes
effective
date
provisions.
26


Under
Iowa
Code
section
622.10,
certain
health
care
27


professionals,
including
mental
health
professionals,
28


are
prohibited,
in
giving
testimony,
from
disclosing
any
29


confidential
communication
that
occurs
between
the
health
care
30


professional
and
a
patient
during
the
course
of
the
patient’s
31


course
of
treatment.
In
State
v.
Cashen,
789
N.W.2d
400
32


(2010),
the
Iowa
Supreme
Court
set
forth
certain
protocol
that
33


must
be
followed
to
balance
a
patient’s
right
to
privacy
with
34


a
defendant’s
right
to
present
evidence
to
a
jury
that
might

influence
the
jury’s
determination
of
guilt
if
privileged
1


mental
health
records
are
made
available
in
a
criminal
2


proceeding.
3


The
bill
amends
Code
section
622.10
to
provide
that,
4


except
as
otherwise
provided
in
the
bill,
the
confidentiality
5


privilege
under
Code
section
622.10
shall
be
absolute
in
6


relation
to
a
criminal
action
and
that
the
bill
shall
not
7


be
construed
to
authorize
or
require
the
disclosure
of
8


any
privileged
records
to
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
action
9


unless
either
the
privilege
holder
voluntarily
waives
the
10


confidentiality
privilege
or
the
defendant
seeking
access
to
11


privileged
records
files
a
motion
demonstrating
in
good
faith
a
12


reasonable
probability
that
the
information
sought
is
likely
13


to
contain
exculpatory
information
that
is
not
available
from
14


any
other
source
and
for
which
there
is
a
compelling
need
for
15


the
defendant
to
present
a
defense
in
the
case.
Failure
of
the
16


defendant
to
timely
file
a
motion
constitutes
a
waiver
of
the
17


right
to
seek
access
to
privileged
records
but
the
court,
for
18


good
cause
shown,
may
grant
relief
from
such
waiver.
19


The
bill
provides
that
if
the
defendant
files
such
a
motion,
20


the
court
shall
conduct
an
in
camera
review
of
such
records
21


to
determine
whether
exculpatory
information
is
contained
in
22


such
records
upon
a
showing
of
a
reasonable
probability
that
23


the
privileged
records
sought
may
likely
contain
exculpatory
24


information
that
is
not
available
from
any
other
source.
If
25


exculpatory
information
is
contained
in
such
records,
the
court
26


is
required
to
balance
the
need
to
disclose
such
information
27


against
the
privacy
interest
of
the
privilege
holder.
If
28


the
court
determines
that
the
privileged
information
sought
29


is
exculpatory
and
that
there
is
a
compelling
need
for
such
30


information
that
outweighs
the
privacy
interests
of
the
31


privilege
holder,
the
court
shall
issue
an
order
allowing
the
32


disclosure
of
only
those
portions
of
the
records
that
contain
33


the
exculpatory
information.
The
court’s
order
shall
also
34


prohibit
any
further
dissemination
of
the
information
to
any

person,
other
than
the
defendant,
the
defendant’s
attorney,

and
the
prosecutor,
unless
otherwise
authorized
by
the
court.
2


The
bill
provides
that
privileged
information
obtained
by
any
3


means
other
than
as
provided
in
the
bill
is
not
admissible
in
4


a
criminal
action.
5


The
bill
makes
a
conforming
amendment
to
Code
section
228.6
6


relating
to
the
compulsory
disclosure
of
mental
health
and
7


psychological
information.
