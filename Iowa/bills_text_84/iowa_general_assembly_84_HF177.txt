the
recall
from
office
of
an
elected
1


official
of
a
political
subdivision
by
the
electors
of
that
2


political
subdivision,
or
election
district,
if
applicable.
3


The
bill
provides
that
a
petition
for
recall
of
an
officer
may
4


be
filed
by
the
eligible
electors
of
a
political
subdivision
5


or
election
district
equal
in
number
to
at
least
20
percent
6


of
the
total
votes
cast
for
the
office
in
question
in
the
7


last
preceding
election,
but
in
no
case
shall
the
number
of
8


signatures
be
less
than
50.
9


If
the
petition
is
filed
in
a
timely
manner,
is
of
legal
10


sufficiency,
is
not
objected
to
in
writing,
and
if
the
officer
11


named
in
the
petition
does
not
resign
from
office,
a
recall
12


election
shall
be
held
on
the
question
of
whether
the
officer
13


shall
be
recalled
from
office.
If
the
officer
resigns,
or
if
a
14


majority
of
the
total
votes
cast
at
the
recall
election
is
in
15


favor
of
the
recall
of
the
officer,
the
vacancy
in
the
office
16


shall
be
filled
in
a
manner
provided
for
that
office
in
Code
17


chapter
69.
18


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
19


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
20


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
21


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
22


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
23


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
