the
school
year
beginning
16


July
1,
2012,
the
earliest
school
start
date
to

25
and
17


eliminates
the
authority
of
the
director
of
the
department
of
18


education
to
grant
a
request
made
by
a
board
of
directors
of
19


a
school
district
to
commence
classes
prior
to
the
earliest
20


starting
date
allowed,
which
currently
is
no
sooner
than
a
day
21


during
the
calendar
week
in
which
the
first
day
of
September
22


falls
or,
if
the
first
day
of
September
falls
on
a
Sunday,
a
day
23


during
the
prior
week.
24


The
bill
makes
a
conforming
change
to
eliminate
an
25


exemption
from
aid
reduction
for
early
school
starts,
unless
26


the
exemption
is
for
a
school
district
approved
to
implement
27


an
innovative
school
year.
Without
the
waiver,
the
school
28


districtâ€™s
state
aid
payments
are
reduced
by
1/180
for
each
day
29


of
that
fiscal
year
for
which
the
school
district
begins
school
30


before
the
earliest
starting
date
allowed.
The
bill
includes
a
31


technical
correction
that
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
