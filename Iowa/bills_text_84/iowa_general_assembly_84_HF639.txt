EXPLANATION
8


This
bill
amends
Code
chapter
103
which
provides
for
9


the
regulation
of
electricians
and
electrical
contractors.
10


The
bill
provides
that
when
the
Code
chapter
uses
the
term
11


“commercial”,
it
refers
to
a
place
of
business
where
goods,
12


wares,
services,
or
merchandise
is
stored
or
offered
for
sale
13


on
a
wholesale
or
retail
basis.
It
refers
to
a
residence
only
14


when
used
as
a
business,
and
it
does
not
refer
to
a
farm,
or
an
15


industrial
installation.
16


Generally,
the
Code
chapter
requires
that
a
person
must
be
17


licensed
as
an
electrical
contractor
to
provide
for
electrical
18


installations.
The
bill
rewrites
a
provision
which
exempts
19


installation
on
farms.
The
bill
provides
that
the
Code
20


chapter’s
requirements
do
not
apply
to
a
person
performing
any
21


installation
by
a
farmer,
employee
or
relative
of
the
farmer,
22


or
farm
operator
or
manager.
An
installation
on
a
farm
does
23


not
require
a
permit
and
does
not
have
to
be
inspected.
