EXPLANATION
18


This
bill
provides
for
the
registration
and
operation
of
19


certain
all-terrain
vehicles
and
minitrucks
on
noninterstate
20


highways.
21


The
bill
provides
a
definition
of
“minitruck”
and
allows
22


unregistered
minitrucks
to
be
operated
on
a
highway
by
a
23


licensed
driver,
without
registration,
for
the
same
purposes
as
24


all-terrain
vehicles:
agricultural
purposes;
land
surveying;
25


construction
or
maintenance
by
a
political
subdivision
or
a
26


public
utility;
emergency
services
or
rescue
performed
by
27


a
public
agency;
or
mowing,
installing
signs,
or
providing
28


maintenance
on
a
snowmobile
or
all-terrain
vehicle
trail
29


designated
by
the
department
of
natural
resources.
A
person
30


who
operates
a
minitruck
in
violation
of
these
restrictions
31


is
subject
to
the
current
penalty
applicable
to
all-terrain
32


vehicle
operation.
A
violation
is
a
simple
misdemeanor,
33


punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$50.
34


The
bill
provides
that
all-terrain
vehicles
with
four

or
more
wheels
and
a
combustion
engine
having
a
piston
or
1


rotor
displacement
of
200
centimeters
or
more
and
minitrucks
2


may
be
registered
with
the
department
of
transportation
for
3


operation
on
noninterstate
highways.
The
provision
includes
4


off-road
utility
vehicles,
which
for
purposes
of
motor
vehicle
5


regulation,
are
included
in
the
definition
of
“all-terrain
6


vehicle”.
To
qualify
for
registration,
the
vehicle
must
7


be
equipped
with
headlights,
taillights,
turn
signals,
and
8


a
rearview
mirror.
A
minitruck
must
also
be
equipped
with
9


windshield
wipers
and
safety
belts.
The
annual
registration
10


fee
for
an
all-terrain
vehicle
or
minitruck
is
$40.
Because
11


all-terrain
vehicles
and
minitrucks
are
currently
subject
to
12


sales
tax,
the
bill
provides
that
the
vehicles
are
exempt
13


from
the
fee
for
new
registration
imposed
on
vehicles
subject
14


to
registration,
so
long
as
the
owner
has
paid
the
sales
15


tax
at
the
time
of
purchase.
The
current
35
mile
per
hour
16


speed
restriction
for
all-terrain
vehicles
is
eliminated
for
17


all-terrain
vehicles
other
than
implements
of
husbandry.
A
18


person
who
operates
on
a
highway
a
vehicle
which
is
required
19


to
be
registered
but
is
not
registered
commits
a
simple
20


misdemeanor,
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$50.
21


Under
current
law,
all-terrain
vehicles
operated
on
public
22


land
or
ice
or
on
designated
riding
areas
or
designated
riding
23


trails
are
required
to
be
registered
with
the
department
24


of
natural
resources.
All-terrain
vehicles
acquired
after
25


January
1,
2000,
other
than
those
used
exclusively
as
farm
26


implements,
must
also
be
titled
by
the
department.
The
bill
27


provides
an
exception
to
that
titling
requirement
for
an
28


all-terrain
vehicle
titled
and
registered
with
the
department
29


of
transportation.
However,
under
the
bill,
an
all-terrain
30


vehicle
which
is
titled
and
registered
for
highway
operation
31


must
still
be
registered
separately
with
the
department
of
32


natural
resources
for
operation
on
public
lands
or
ice
or
on
33


designated
riding
areas
and
designated
riding
trails.
34


The
bill
provides
an
exemption
from
