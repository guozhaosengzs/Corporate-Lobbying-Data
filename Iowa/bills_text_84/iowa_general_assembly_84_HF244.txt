EXPLANATION
29


This
bill
relates
to
the
release
and
satisfaction
of
30


judgments.
31


Current
law
provides
that
a
party
serving
a
written
demand
32


on
a
judgment
lien
against
a
homestead
may
obtain
an
immediate
33


court
order
releasing
the
claimed
lien
by
posting
a
cash
bond
34


with
the
clerk
of
court.
The
bill
provides
that
the
court
35


-2-


LSB

(5)
84


rh/nh

4





























H.F.
244


may
order
that,
in
lieu
of
posting
the
bond
with
the
clerk
of
1


court,
the
bond
may
be
deposited
in
either
the
trust
account
2


of
an
attorney
licensed
to
practice
law
in
this
state
or
in
3


a
federally
insured
depository
institution,
along
with
the
4


restriction
that
the
bond
not
be
disbursed
except
as
the
court
5


may
direct.
6


Current
law
provides
that
when
the
amount
due
on
a
judgment
7


is
paid
off
or
satisfied
in
full,
the
judgment
creditor
must
8


acknowledge
satisfaction
of
the
judgment
by
executing
and
9


filing
an
instrument
with
the
clerk
of
court
in
every
county
10


where
the
judgment
is
a
lien.
Failure
to
do
so
within
30
11


days
subjects
the
judgment
creditor
to
a
penalty
of
$100
12


plus
reasonable
attorney
fees.
The
bill
amends
this
law
13


to
provide
that
the
judgment
creditor
may
instead
have
the
14


instrument
acknowledging
satisfaction
of
the
debt
notarized
in
15


the
manner
prescribed
in
Code
chapter
9E.
The
bill
increases
16


the
penalty
for
failing
to
acknowledge
the
satisfaction
of
17


the
debt
in
such
a
manner
to
$400
but
eliminates
the
recovery
18


of
attorney
fees.
The
bill
provides
that
the
penalty
may
be
19


recovered
by
a
motion
filed
in
the
court
that
rendered
the
20


original
judgment
requesting
that
the
payor
of
the
judgment,
21


if
different
from
the
judgment
debtor,
be
subrogated
to
the
22


rights
of
the
judgment
creditor,
that
the
court
determine
the
23


amount
currently
owed
on
the
judgment,
or
any
other
relief
as
24


may
be
necessary
to
accomplish
payment
and
satisfaction
of
the
25


judgment.
If
the
motion
relates
to
a
lien
of
judgment
as
to
26


specific
property,
the
motion
may
be
filed
by
a
person
with
an
27


interest
in
the
property.
28


The
bill
also
provides
that
upon
the
filing
of
an
affidavit
29


that
a
judgment
creditor
cannot
be
located
or
is
unresponsive
30


to
requests
to
accept
payment,
payment
upon
a
judgment
may
be
31


made
to
the
treasurer
of
state
as
provided
in
Code
chapter
556
32


and
the
treasurer’s
receipt
for
the
funds
is
conclusive
proof
33


of
payment
on
the
judgment.
34


The
bill
provides
that
the
district
court
sitting
in
