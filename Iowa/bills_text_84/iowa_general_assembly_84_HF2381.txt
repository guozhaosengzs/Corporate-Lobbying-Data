EXPLANATION
1


Current
law
provides
for
an
assessment
(a
so-called
2


checkoff)
on
the
sale
of
sheep
and
wool
to
first
purchasers.
3


The
assessment
is
ultimately
expended
by
the
Iowa
sheep
and
4


wool
promotion
board
for
purposes
of
promoting
the
marketing
5


of
sheep
and
wool
and
to
provide
for
related
education
and
6


research
programs.
The
board
operates
and
the
checkoff
is
7


imposed
pursuant
to
a
referendum
approved
by
sheep
and
wool
8


producers.
9


This
bill
authorizes
the
board
to
conduct
a
special
10


referendum
to
increase
the
checkoff
rate
for
each
head
of
11


sheep
from
10
cents
to
25
cents,
and
to
authorize
the
board
12


to
increase
the
rate
in
the
future
by
board
resolution.
The
13


bill
requires
that
the
special
referendum
be
conducted
in
the
14


same
manner
as
the
referendum
establishing
the
board
and
first
15


imposing
the
assessment
rate,
unless
the
board’s
resolution
16


provides
otherwise.
However,
the
resolution
cannot
alter
two
17


provisions;
only
producers
are
eligible
to
vote
in
an
election
18


and
each
producer
is
entitled
to
one
vote.
The
bill
places
a
19


number
of
conditions
upon
the
board’s
resolution
to
further
20


increase
the
rate.
First,
it
must
wait
three
or
more
years
21


from
the
effective
date
of
the
previous
increase
in
order
to
22


adopt
such
a
resolution.
Second,
it
must
provide
notice
to
and
23


an
opportunity
for
comment
by
producers.
Third,
the
increased
24


rate
must
equal
5
cents.
Finally,
the
board
cannot
increase
25


the
rate
to
more
than
50
cents
per
head
of
sheep.
26


The
bill
provides
that
the
result
of
moving
and
rewriting
27


a
provision
that
imposes
the
current
assessment
rate
does
28


not
affect
the
prior
establishment
of
the
board
or
the
prior
29


imposition
of
that
rate
as
established
by
referendum.
30


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
