EXPLANATION
6


This
joint
resolution
relates
to
the
terms
of
office
7


for
supreme
court
justices
and
district
judges
under
the
8


Constitution
of
the
State
of
Iowa.
9


The
resolution
requires
each
supreme
court
justice
to
be
10


retained
in
office
every
six
years
after
serving
an
initial
11


term
of
office
of
up
to
two
years.
The
constitution
currently
12


requires
each
justice
of
the
supreme
court
to
be
retained
in
13


office
every
eight
years
after
serving
an
initial
term
of
14


office
of
up
to
two
years.
The
resolution
does
not
affect
the
15


length
of
a
regular
term
of
office
for
a
district
judge.
16


The
resolution
provides
that
a
supreme
court
justice
or
a
17


district
judge
shall
not
serve
more
than
one
regular
term
of
18


office
and
one
succeeding
regular
term
of
office
for
the
office
19


of
appointment
beginning
with
the
judicial
election
in
2016.
20


The
resolution
also
provides
that
a
current
supreme
court
21


justice
or
district
judge
may
stand
for
retention
one
time
for
22


such
office
after
the
judicial
election
in
2016,
then
such
23


office
shall
become
vacant,
and
a
new
judge
appointed,
unless
24


the
judge
has
never
been
on
the
ballot
for
such
office
as
of
25


January
1,
2015,
in
such
case
the
judge
may
stand
for
retention
26


two
times
beginning
with
the
judicial
election
in
2016.
27


The
resolution
is
silent,
as
is
the
current
Iowa
28


Constitution,
regarding
the
nomination
and
appointment
of
29


judges
of
the
court
of
appeals.
30


The
resolution
if
adopted,
would
be
referred
to
the
next
31


general
assembly
(Eighty-fifth)
for
adoption
a
second
time
32


before
the
amendment
is
submitted
to
the
electorate
for
33


ratification.
34


The
amendment,
if
adopted
and
ratified

the
electorate,
