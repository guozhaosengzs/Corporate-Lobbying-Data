EXPLANATION
6


BACKGROUND.
There
are
a
number
of
different
types
of
7


property
that
are
not
subject
to
property
tax,
including
land
8


designated
as
native
prairie
or
wetland
as
designated
by
the
9


department
of
natural
resources
(Code
section
427.1(23)(a)).
10


In
order
for
a
wetland
to
qualify
for
the
tax
exemption,
11


it
must
be
designated
as
“protected”,
meaning
that
it
is
a
12


type
of
wetland
described
by
the
United
States
department
of
13


interior
(Code
section
456B.1).
Such
land
is
inventoried
by
14


the
department
(Code
section
456B.12).
The
wetland
may
be
15


restored.
However,
it
cannot
be
used
for
economic
gain.
The
16


assessing
authority
(county)
is
entitled
to
be
reimbursed
17


for
lost
tax
revenue
due
to
the
exemption
(Code
section
18


427.1(23)(b)).
19


BILL’S
PROVISIONS.
This
bill
changes
the
name
of
qualifying
20


wetlands
to
“preserved
wetlands”
and
provides
that
land
21


qualifies
as
a
preserved
wetland
if
it
includes
more
than
two
22


acres
and
is:
(1)
classified
as
a
protected
wetland,
(2)
23


classified
as
a
wetland
by
the
United
States
natural
resource
24


conservation
service,
or
(3)
is
inundated
or
saturated
by
water
25


sufficient
to
support
life
adapted
to
wetland
conditions.
The
26


bill
also
provides
that
the
tax
exemption
applies
if
the
land
27


is
used
for
economic
gain
if
it
is
directly
related
to
its
use
28


as
a
habitat
or
if
it
is
farm
payments.
