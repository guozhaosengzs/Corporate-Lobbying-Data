of
automated

images
of
motor
vehicles
14


violating
a
railroad
grade
crossing
signal
light,
or
any

official
traffic-control
device
if
failure
to
comply
with
the
16


traffic-control
device
would
constitute
a
moving
violation
17


if
cited
under
state
law.
The

includes

its
scope
devices

constitute
municipal

23


Under
the
bill,
a
city
that
has
an
automated
traffic
24


enforcement
program
must
establish
a
separate
account
in
the
25


city’s
general

be
used
first

pay
28


the
costs

the
city’s
automated
traffic
enforcement
program.
29


Any
remaining
moneys
in
the
account
are
to
be
used
annually
30


to
reduce
the
city’s
property
tax
levy
to
be
certified

the
31


following
