EXPLANATION
13


This
bill
establishes
standards
and
requirements
for
the
14


construction
and
maintenance
of
walkways
in
rail
yards.
The
15


provisions
of
the
bill
apply
to
all
walkways
in
rail
yards
in
16


this
state,
but
do
not
apply
to
tracks
in
industry
yards
owned
17


by
an
entity
other
than
a
rail
carrier.
18


The
bill
specifies
that
walkways
may
be
surfaced
with
19


asphalt,
concrete,
planking,
grating,
native
material,
crushed
20


material,
or
other
similar
material.
If
crushed
material
is
21


used,
100
percent
of
the
material
must
be
able
to
pass
through
22


a
one
and
one-half
inch
sieve
opening,
and
at
least
90
percent
23


of
the
material
must
be
able
to
pass
through
a
one-inch
sieve
24


opening,
with
allowance
for
a
de
minimus
variation.
The
25


bill
contains
general
recommendations
for
the
use
of
crushed
26


material.
In
addition,
the
bill
requires
that
walkways
be
27


at
least
two
feet
wide,
with
cross
slopes
of
not
more
than
28


one
inch
of
elevation
for
each
eight
inches
of
length
in
any
29


direction.
Walkways
must
have
a
reasonably
uniform
surface,
30


be
maintained
in
safe
condition
without
compromising
track
31


drainage,
and
be
kept
reasonably
free
of
spilled
fuel
oil,
32


sand,
posts,
vegetation,
nonballast
rocks,
and
other
hazards
33


and
obstructions.
34


The
bill
establishes
a
standard
requirement
for
rail
35


-3-

carriers
to
provide
walkways
adjacent
to
portions
of
yard
1


tracks
where
rail
carrier
employees
work
on
the
ground
2


performing
switching
activities
at
least
five
days
per
week,
3


one
shift
per
day.
However,
following
an
administrative
4


hearing,
the
department
of
transportation
may
order
a
rail
5


carrier
to
construct
a
walkway
or
conform
a
preexisting
walkway
6


to
the
new
standards
along
any
portion
of
track
where
the
lack
7


of
a
walkway
or
condition
of
a
walkway
poses
a
safety
hazard
8


to
employees
performing
switching
activities
for
any
period
of
9


time.
10


The
bill
excuses
a
rail
carrier
from
compliance
with
walkway
11


requirements
during
maintenance
activities
and
during
periods
12


of
heavy
rain
or
snow,
derailment,
rock
and
earth
slides,
13


washouts,
or
other
weather
or
seismic
conditions,
and
for
a
14


reasonable
period
following
such
an
occurrence.
15


The
department
of
transportation
may
grant
a
waiver
of
any
16


provision
of
the
bill
to
a
rail
carrier
upon
a
showing
of
good
17


cause,
including
but
not
limited
to
a
showing
that
compliance
18


will
impose
an
undue
hardship
on
the
rail
carrier.
19


A
party
who
alleges
a
violation
of
the
requirements
of
the
20


bill
may
not
file
a
formal
complaint
until
the
filing
party
has
21


made
a
good
faith
attempt
to
address
the
alleged
violation
with
22


the
rail
carrier.
A
violation
of
the
bill’s
provisions
is
a
23


“schedule
one”
violation,
punishable
by
a
$100
fine
for
each
24


day
a
violation
exists.
25


The
bill
makes
technical
changes
to
Code
chapter
327F
to
26


codify
definitions
applicable
to
the
bill
and
to
the
entire
27


Code
chapter.
