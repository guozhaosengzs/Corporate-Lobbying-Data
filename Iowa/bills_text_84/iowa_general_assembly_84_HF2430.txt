government’s
determination
pursuant
to
8
7


U.S.C.

16


establishes
a
conclusive
affirmative
defense
that
the

not
knowingly
employ
an

alien.
An
employer
is
18


considered
to
have
complied
with
the
requirements
of
8
U.S.C.
§
19


1324a(b),
notwithstanding
an
isolated,
sporadic,
or
accidental
20


technical
or
procedural
failure
to
meet
the
requirements,
if
21


there
is
a
good-faith
attempt
to
comply
with
the
requirements.

evidence
the
substantial
elements
of
the
violation.
An
27


employer
who
asserts
an
entrapment
defense
has
the
burden
28


of
proving
all
of
the
following
by
a
preponderance
of
the
29


evidence:
30


(1)
The
idea
of
committing
the
violation
started
with
law
31


enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
rather
than
with
the
32


employer.
33


(2)
The
law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
urged
and
34


induced
the
employer
to
commit
the
violation.

(3)
The
employer
was
not
predisposed
to
commit
the
violation
1


before
the
law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
urged
and
2


induced
the
employer
to
commit
the
violation.

b.
An
employer
does
not
establish
entrapment
if
the
employer
4


was
predisposed
to
violate
subsection
1
and
the
law
enforcement
5


officers
or
their
agents
merely
provided
the
employer
with
an
6


opportunity
to
commit
the
violation.
It
is
not
entrapment
for
7


law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
merely
to
use
a
ruse
8


or
to
conceal
their
identity.
The
conduct
of
law
enforcement
9


officers
and

agents
may
be
considered
in
determining
if
10


an
employer
has
proven
entrapment.

EXPLANATION
12


This

The

14


state
to
prescribe
a

form
for
alleged

of
15


the
prohibition.
The
bill
provides
that
complaints
may
be
16


submitted
to
the
county
sheriff
or
local
law
enforcement
agency
17


in
the
county
in
which
the
alleged
unauthorized
alien
is
or

18


employed
by
the
employer.
The
bill
directs
the
county
sheriff
19


or

they
20


receive,
and
to
verify
the
work
authorization
of
an
alleged
21


unauthorized
alien
with
the
federal
government.
The
bill
22


provides
that
the
investigation
is
discretionary
for
complaints
23


which
do
not
name
specific
employees,
anonymous
complaints,
24


and
complaints
not
submitted
on
a
prescribed
complaint
form.
25


The
bill
prohibits
the
county
sheriff
or
local
law
enforcement
26


agency
from
investigating
complaints
that
are
based
solely
27


on
race,
color,
or
national
origin.
The
bill
provides
that
28


a
person
who
knowingly
files
a
false
or
frivolous
complaint
29


is
guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor,
which
is
punishable
by
30


confinement
for
no
more
than
30
days
or
a
fine
of
at
least
$65
31


but
not
more
than
$625
or
by
both.
32


The
bill
requires
the
county
sheriff
or
local
law
33


enforcement
agency
to
notify
United
States
immigration
and
34


customs
enforcement
and
the

that
is
not
false
and
not
frivolous.
The
bill
requires
the
1


county
attorney
to
bring
an
action
in
district
court
against
an
2


employer
for
a
violation
in
the
county
where
the
unauthorized
3


alien
employee
is
or
was
employed
by
the
employer.
The
bill
4


provides
that
such
an
action
must
be
expedited
by
the
court.
5


The
bill
provides
that
for
a
first
violation,
the
court
6


must
order
the
employer
to
terminate
the
employment
of
all
7


unauthorized
aliens
and
to
submit
a
signed
sworn
affidavit
8


to
that
effect
or
face
suspension
of
business
licenses
by
9


appropriate
agencies.
The
court
will
also
order
a
three-year
10


probationary
period
for
the
employer.
The
court
may
also
11


order
the
suspension
of
the
employer’s
business
licenses
12


by
appropriate
agencies
for
up
to
10
business
days,
after
13


considering
certain
factors.
The
bill
provides
that
for
a
14


second
violation,
defined
as
a
violation
occurring
during
a
15


probationary
period
for
a
previous
violation,
the
court
must
16


order
the
permanent
revocation
of
the
employer’s
business
17


licenses.
The
bill
directs
the
secretary
of
state
to
maintain
18


an
online
database
of
first-time
offenders.
19


The
bill
provides
that
the
district
court
can
only
consider
20


a
determination
by
the
federal
government
in
determining
the
21


immigration
status
of
an
alleged
unauthorized
alien
employed
22


by
an
employer.
The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
who
23


establishes
that
the
employer
complied
in
good
faith
with
8
24


U.S.C.
§
1324a(b)
establishes
a
conclusive
affirmative
defense
25


that
the
employer
did
not
knowingly
employ
an
unauthorized
26


alien.
The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
is
considered
to
27


have
complied
with
the
requirements
of
8
U.S.C.
§
1324a(b),
28


notwithstanding
an
isolated,
sporadic,
or
accidental
technical
29


or
procedural
failure
to
meet
the
requirements,
if
there
is
a
30


good-faith
attempt
to
comply
with
the
requirements.
The
bill
31


provides
an
employer
with
an
affirmative
defense
of
entrapment
32


if
certain
elements
are
met.
33


The
bill
requires
an
employer
hiring
a
new
employee
to
34


verify
the
employee’s
employment
eligibility
through
the
35

federal
e-verify
program.
The
bill
requires
the
employer
1


to
keep
records
of
the
verification
for
the
duration
of
the
2


employee’s
employment
or
three
years,
whichever
is
longer.
The
3


bill
requires
an
employer
receiving
an
economic
development
4


incentive
from
a
state
government
entity
to
register
with
the
5


federal
e-verify
program.
The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
6


who
does
not
comply
with
the
requirement
must
repay
all
moneys
7


received
for
the
economic
development
incentive.
The
bill
8


provides
an
employer
the
right
to
appeal
a
determination
of
9


noncompliance,
and
does
not
require
repayment
until
a
final
10


determination
of
noncompliance
is
made.
The
bill
directs
the
11


secretary
of
state
to
request
from
the
United
States
department
12


of
homeland
security
a
list
of
employers
registered
with
the
13


e-verify
program
every
three
months.
The
bill
directs
the
14


secretary
of
state
to
make
the
list
available
on
the
secretary
15


of
state’s
internet
site.
16


The
bill
provides
that
the
bill
shall
not
be
construed
17


to
require
an
employer
to
take
any
action
that
the
employer
18


believes
in
good
faith
would
violate
federal
or
state
law.
19


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
20


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
21


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
22


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
23


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
24


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
25


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
