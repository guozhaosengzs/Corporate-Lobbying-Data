of
an
assessor
by

include
a
severe
lack
of
2


transparency,
a
severe
lack
of
communication
with
constituents,
3


or
the
loss
of
records.
The
bill
also
requires
that
a
4


conference
board
review
the
job
status
of
the
assessor
if
the
5


conference
board
is
petitioned
to
do
so
by
eligible
electors
6


equal
to
at
least
10
percent
of
the
individuals

bill
requires
the

12


increase
of
$25,000
or
more
in
property
taxes
on
the
property,
13


except
where
the
increased
valuation
is
due
to
new
construction
14


or
improvements
to
the
property.
15


The
bill
requires
that
county
boards
of
review
be
appointed

boards
of
review
for

respective
conference
board.
The
bill
does
not
amend
19


current
law
pertaining
to
city
boards
of
review.
The
bill
20


further
requires
that
a
county
board
of
supervisors
may

a
new
county
board
of
review
if

board
of
supervisors
is

so
by
eligible
electors
equal
to
at
least
10
23


percent
of
