and
creates
a
new
crime
of
going
armed
with
a
knife
in
the
2


commission
of
a
crime,
an
aggravated
misdemeanor.
The

conforming
change
to
Code
section

to
the
crime
of
9


possession

the
permit
is
issued
is
12


intoxicated,
as

in
Code
section
321J.2,
subsection

dangerous
weapon
on
or
about
the
person
or
carries
a
dangerous
21


weapon
within
the
person’s
immediate
access
or
reach
while
in
22


a
vehicle.
This
crime
does
not
apply
to
situations
where
a
23


person
carries
or
possesses
a
dangerous
weapon
while
in
the
24


person’s
own
dwelling,
place
of
business,
or
on
the
person’s
25


land,
and
the
transitory
possession
or
use
of
a
firearm
during
26


an
act
of
justified
self-defense

justified
defense
of
27


another,
if
the
possession
of
the
firearm
lasts
no
longer
than
28


immediately
necessary
to
resolve
the
emergency.
29


The
bill

section
to
provide
that
the

shall
not
be
construed
34


to
