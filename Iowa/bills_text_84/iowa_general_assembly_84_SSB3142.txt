Prior
to
considering
proposed
legislation
to
regulate
an
1


unregulated
health
profession
for
passage
to
the
floor
of
the
2


senate
or
the
house
of
representatives,
a
legislative
committee
3


to
which
proposed
legislation
to
regulate
an
unregulated
4


health
profession
has
been
referred
shall
consider
whether
the
5


conditions
in
subsection
1
have
been
met.
If
the
committee
6


finds
that
the
conditions
in
subsection
1
have
been
met,
the
7


committee
shall
consider
whether
the
legislation
is
the
least
8


restrictive
method
of
regulation
to
address
the
specific
harm
9


or
danger
identified
in
this
subsection.
10


a.
If
existing
common
law
and
statutory
civil
actions
and
11


criminal
prohibitions
are
not
sufficient
to
eradicate
existing
12


harm,
the
legislation
shall
provide
for
stricter
civil
actions
13


and
criminal
prohibitions.
14


b.
If
a
service
is
being
performed
for
individuals
that
15


involves
a
hazard
to
the
public
health,
safety,
or
welfare,
the
16


legislation
shall
impose
inspection
requirements
and
enable
an
17


appropriate
state
entity
to
respond
to
a
violation
by
seeking
18


injunctive
relief
in
court.
19


c.
If
the
threat
to
the
public
health,
safety,
or
welfare
20


is
relatively
small
as
a
result
of
the
operation
of
the
21


unregulated
health
profession,
the
legislation
shall
implement
22


a
system
of
registration.
23


d.
If
a
consumer
may
have
a
substantial
basis
for
relying
24


on
the
services
of
a
practitioner
of
an
unregulated
health
25


profession,
the
legislation
shall
implement
a
system
of
26


certification.


27


e.
If
the
legislative
committee
determines
that
adequate
28


regulation
cannot
be
achieved
by
means
other
than
licensing,
29


the

shall
implement
a

and
the

must
then
verify
that

only

not

The

assembly
11


introducing

to
impose
or

a

requirement
on

The
bill
requires
a
legislative
committee
reviewing
18


legislation
to
impose
a
regulation
on
an
unregulated
nonhealth
19


profession
to
consider
whether
the
unregulated
practice
of
the
20


profession
can
clearly
harm
the
public,
whether
the
benefits
21


of
regulation
clearly
exceeds
the
costs
imposed
on
consumers,
22


and
whether
the

needs
assurances

ability.
If
the
committee
finds
in

affirmative
with

respect

factors,

evidence
of
actual
harm
to

public
related

to

for

If
the
committee
finds
that
regulation
is

necessary,
the

shall
review
the
legislation
to

determine
whether
it

necessary

——
STATE
BOARD
AND
AGENCY
SUNSET
REVIEW.
This
10


division
relates
to
the
sunset
of
state
boards
and
agencies.
11


The
bill
defines
“sunset”
as
the
cessation
of
all
activities
12


of
a
board
or
agency.
The
bill
creates
a
sunset
advisory
13


committee
(the
committee)
consisting
of
three
members
of
the
14


senate
appointed
by
the
majority
leader
of
the
senate,
two
15


members
of
the
senate
appointed
by
the
minority
leader
of
the
16


senate,
three
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
appointed
17


by
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives,
and
two
members
18


of
the
house
of
representatives
appointed
by
the
minority
19


leader
of
the
house
of
representatives.
The
bill
includes
20


rules
for
the
operation
of
the
committee.
21


The
bill
creates
a
process
for
the
sunset
of
all
boards
that
22


license,
register,
or
certify
a
profession
in
the
state.
The
23


bill
sets
a
schedule
to
sunset
all
such
boards
on
December
24


31
of
the
fifth
calendar
year
after
the
date
the
board
was
25


created
or
last
renewed,
or
on
December
31,
2026,
whichever
is
26


later,
subject
to
the
committee’s
review,
and
on
December
31
27


every
five
calendar
years
thereafter
if
renewed.
A
board
that
28


has
been
scheduled
to
sunset
shall
sunset
on
June
30
of
the
29


following
year.
Once
a
board
has
sunset,
any
individual
may
30


practice
a
profession
previously
licensed
by
the
board
without
31


obtaining
a
license.
If
a
board
performs
functions
other
than
32


licensing,
it
may
continue
to
perform
those
functions.
The
33


sunset
of
a
board
may
be
prevented
by
the
passage
of
a
bill
34


continuing
the
existence
of
the
board.

several

12


After

13


a

The
bill
sets
the
initial
date
for
21


the

of
the

22


An

prevented
from
sunsetting
by
enactment
of
a
23


statute
continuing
the
existence
of
the
agency,
which
shall
24


also
schedule
an
additional

of
the
agency
in
no

and
the
committee
shall
submit
28


a

containing
its
findings
and

for
each

agency.
The
recommendations
of
the

shall
be

the

The

33


The

The

The
principles
created
by
the

bill
include
a
policy
of
enacting
the
least
restrictive
19


regulation
necessary
to
protect
the
public,
encouraging
20


economic
opportunities
and
competition,
providing

The

does
not
prohibit
a

board
from

26


The
