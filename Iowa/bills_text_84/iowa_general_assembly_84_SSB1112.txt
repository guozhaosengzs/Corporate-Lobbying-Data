constitute
agreement
with
26


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general

on

ability
of
cities
and

counties,
referred

The
bill
prohibits
political

licensing
requirements
or
31


professional
or
occupational
fees
beginning
January
1,
2020.

33


licensing

The

S.F.
_____


to
refuse
to
grant
a
license
on
the
basis
of
an
applicant’s
1


criminal
record
by
requiring
licensing
authorities
to
2


specifically
list
the
offenses
that
could
disqualify
an
3


applicant
and
to
specifically
detail
the
grounds
for
4


disqualification
of
each
applicant.
A
licensing
authority
5


cannot
disqualify
an
applicant
for
an
arrest
not
followed
by
6


a
conviction
or
for
a
conviction
that
occurred
more
than
five
7


years
ago,
provided
that
the
offense
was
not
violent
or
sexual
8


in
nature,
or
based
on
a
finding
that
an
applicant
lacks
good
9


character
or
suffers
from
moral
turpitude.
10


A
disqualified
person
who
commits
an
additional
11


disqualifying
offense
during
the
period
of
disqualification
or
12


who
is
disqualified
based
on
a
violent
or
sexual
crime
may
not
13


be
disqualified
for
longer
than
five
years
following
release
14


from
incarceration.
An
applicant
who
is
denied
a
license
on
15


the
basis
of
a
criminal
record
is
entitled
to
an
administrative
16


review
and
any
review
in
civil
court
permitted
by
Code
chapter
17


17A.
The
licensing
authority
bears
the
burden
of
proof
in
such
18


proceedings.
The
bill
also
requires
licensing
authorities
to
19


respond
to
inquiries
as
to
whether
an
individual’s
criminal
20


record
would
disqualify
the
individual
from
obtaining
a
21


license.
22


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
23


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
24


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
25


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
26


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
27


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
28


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
29


The
bill
applies
to
licensing
decisions
made
on
or
after
30


January
1,
2020.
