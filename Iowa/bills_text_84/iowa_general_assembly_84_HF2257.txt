EXPLANATION
18


This
bill
relates
to
the
grounds
that
an
agency
may
use
19


to
deny,
revoke,
or
suspend
a
professional
or
occupational
20


license.
Currently,
many
licensing
statutes
cite
as
21


disciplinary
grounds
conviction
of
a
“crime”
related
to
the
22


profession
or
occupation.
The
bill
substitutes
“felony”
for
23


“crime”,
except
for
those
occupations
relating
to
the
care
24


of
the
ill,
the
elderly
or
infirm,
or
the
care
of
children
25


in
which
case
“public
offense”
is
substituted.
The
term
26


“public
offense”
is
defined
in
Code
section
701.2
as
“that
27


which
is
prohibited
by
statute
and
is
punishable
by
fine
or
28


imprisonment”.
29


The
bill
requires
that
each
board
or
commission
adopt
rules
30


of
procedure
for
the
conduct
of
agency
meetings.
