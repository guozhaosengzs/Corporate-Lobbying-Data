promotion
of
renewable
fuels,
including
ethanol
used
in
the

formulation
of
gasoline
containing
various
percentages
of
2


fuel
grade
alcohol
and
biodiesel
used
in
the
formulation
of
3


diesel
fuel
containing
various
percentages
of
oils
or
fats.
4


Renewable
fuel
is
classified
according
to
those
designations.
5


For
example,
E-10
contains
between
9
and
10
percent
ethanol,
6


E-15
contains
at
least
15
percent
ethanol
but
is
not
classified
7


as
E-85.
E-85
contains
between
70
and
85
percent
ethanol,
8


B-2
contains
2
percent
biodiesel,
and
B-5
contains
5
percent
9


biodiesel
(Code
section
214A.2).
The
bill
concerns
retail
10


dealers
of
renewable
fuels
(persons
selling
a
renewable
fuel
11


on
a
retail
basis).
The
bill
addresses
the
following
state
12


agencies:
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship
13


(DALS),
the
department
of
revenue
(DOR),
and
the
department
of
14


economic
development
(DED).
15


RETAIL
DEALERS
——
MOTOR
FUEL
STANDARDS.
DALS
regulates
16


standards
for
motor
fuel
based
on
specifications
promulgated
17


by
A.S.T.M.
international
(Code
section
214A.2).
The
bill
18


provides
a
new
standard
for
biodiesel
blended
fuel
classified
19


from
B-6
to
B-20
based
on
A.S.T.M.
international
specification
20


D7467.
21


RETAIL
DEALERS
——
LIABILITY.
The
bill
provides
that
a
22


retail
dealer
regulated
under
Code
chapter
214A
is
not
liable
23


for
damages
caused
to
a
motor
by
the
use
of
an
incompatible
24


motor
fuel
(e.g.,
the
use
of
E-85
gasoline
in
a
conventional
25


gasoline-powered
motor).
The
bar
against
liability
depends
26


upon
the
satisfaction
of
certain
conditions:
(1)
the
motor
27


fuel
must
meet
legal
specifications,
(2)
the
retail
dealer
28


cannot
have
selected
it
for
use
in
the
motor,
and
(3)
the
29


dispensing
pump
must
be
correctly
labeled.
30


RETAIL
DEALERS
——
TAX
CREDITS.
The
bill
amends
a
number
of
31


existing
tax
credits
and
creates
a
new
tax
credit
for
retail
32


dealers
who
sell
and
dispense
renewable
fuel.
Generally,
a
tax
33


credit
is
calculated
on
a
calendar
year
basis
regardless
of
34


whether
the
tax
credit
is
claimed
on
a
retail
dealer’s
calendar

The
tax
credits
apply
1


to
individual
and
corporate
tax
filers.
2


ETHANOL
PROMOTION
TAX
CREDIT.
The
bill
amends
the
ethanol
3


promotion
tax
credit
(Code
sections
422.11N
and
422.33,
4


subsection
11A).
The
tax
credit
is
calculated
and
claimed
on
5


100
percent
ethanol
used
in
ethanol
blended
gasoline
sold
and
6


dispensed
by
a
retail
dealer
as
ethanol
blended
gasoline.
7


Under
current
law,
the
tax
credit
rate
depends
upon
the
8


retail
dealer’s
total
ethanol
gallonage
plus
the
retail
9


dealer’s
total
biodiesel
gallonage
(referred
to
as
the
retail
10


dealer’s
biofuel
distribution
percentage).
There
are
two
11


tax
credit
schedules
based
on
the
dealer’s
biofuel
threshold
12


percentage:
the
first
schedule
applies
to
retail
dealers
who
13


sell
and
distribute
more
than
200,000
gallons
of
motor
fuel
in
14


a
calendar
year
(determination
period)
and
the
second
schedule
15


applies
to
retail
dealers
who
sell
200,000
gallons
or
less
of
16


motor
fuel
in
the
same
determination
period.
The
tax
credit
is
17


eliminated
on
January
1,
2021.
18


The
bill
adjusts
the
tax
credit
rates
for
retail
dealers
who
19


either
meet
or
do
not
attain
the
applicable
biofuel
threshold
20


percentage
for
a
determination
period.
A
disparity
occurs
21


when
a
retail
dealer’s
disparity
equals
2
percent
or
less
or
22


equals
more
than
2
percent
but
not
more
than
4
percent.
In
23


calendar
year
2011,
the
tax
credit
rate
is
increased
from
6.5
24


to
8
cents
for
a
determination
period
in
which
the
retail
25


dealer
attains
the
biofuel
threshold
percentage.
In
calendar
26


year
2011,
the
tax
credit
rate
for
a
disparity
of
2
percent
27


or
less
is
increased
from
4.5
to
6
cents.
In
2011,
the
tax
28


credit
rate
for
a
disparity
of
more
than
2
percent
but
not
more
29


than
4
percent
remains
at
2.5
cents
and
in
2012,
the
tax
credit
30


rate
for
such
disparity
is
increased
to
4
cents.
The
bill
also
31


allows
a
retail
dealer
to
calculate
the
tax
credit
based
on
a
32


site-by-site
basis
(each
individual
motor
fuel
site
operated
by
33


a
retail
dealer)
or
a
company-wide
basis
(all
motor
fuel
sites
34


operated
by
a
retail
dealer)
assuming
that

retail
dealer’s

The
bill
also
amends
provisions
requiring
retail
2


dealers
to
report
motor
fuel
gallonage
to
DOR,
by
specifically
3


recognizing
site-by-site
or
company-wide
reporting.
The
4


provisions
are
retroactively
applicable
to
January
1,
2011.
5


E-85
GASOLINE
PROMOTION
TAX
CREDIT.
The
bill
amends
the
6


E-85
promotion
tax
credit
(Code
sections
422.11O
and
422.33,
7


subsection
11B)
based
on
the
total
gallons
of
E-85
gasoline
8


sold
and
dispensed
by
the
retail
dealer.
The
bill
eliminates
9


the
current
declining
tax
credit
rate
schedule
allowing
for
25
10


cents
per
gallon
of
E-85
gasoline
in
calendar
year
2006
to
1
11


cent
in
calendar
year
2020,
and
fixes
the
tax
credit
rate
at
a
12


constant
16
cents
for
each
calendar
year
until
the
end
of
2017.
13


The
new
rate
takes
effect
July
1,
2011.
It
applies
to
tax
years
14


beginning
on
and
after
that
date.
15


RETAIL
DEALERS
——
BIODIESEL
BLENDED
FUEL
TAX
CREDIT.
The
16


bill
amends
the
biodiesel
blended
fuel
tax
credit
based
on
the
17


total
gallons
of
biodiesel
blended
fuel
sold
and
dispensed
18


(Code
sections
422.11P
and
422.33,
subsection
11C).
Currently,
19


the
tax
credit
is
multiplied
by
taking
a
constant
(designated)
20


rate
multiplied
by
the
number
of
gallons
of
B-2
or
higher
sold
21


and
dispensed.
The
tax
credit
is
due
to
expire
at
the
end
of
22


calendar
year
2011.
23


The
bill
eliminates
an
eligibility
requirement
specifying
24


that
of
all
gallons
of
diesel
fuel
sold
and
dispensed
by
a
25


retail
dealer,
50
percent
or
more
must
be
biodiesel
blended
26


fuel.
It
establishes
a
tax
credit
rate
for
calendar
year
2012
27


based
on
whether
the
retail
dealer
sold
or
dispensed
is
B-2
or
28


higher.
The
designated
rate
is
3
cents.
Beginning
in
calendar
29


year
2013,
the
tax
credit
rate
is
only
calculated
on
B-5
and
30


higher.
The
tax
credit
rate
for
each
gallon
of
B-5
or
higher
is
31


5
cents.
The
tax
credit
is
extended
until

end

year

RENEWABLE
FUEL
INFRASTRUCTURE.
The
bill
amends
provisions
11


which
establish
a
renewable
fuel
infrastructure
board
12


(Code
section
15G.202)
which
includes
members
representing
13


agricultural
producers,
petroleum
refiners,
petroleum
14


marketers,
petroleum
equipment
contractors,
the
trucking
15


industry,
insurers,
and
the
renewable
fuels
industry.
The
16


board
is
housed
within
DED.
The
board,
with
assistance
17


from
DED,
is
responsible
for
administering
two
programs:
18


the
renewable
fuel
infrastructure
program
for
retail
motor
19


fuel
sites
(Code
section
15G.203)
and
the
renewable
fuel
20


infrastructure
program
for
biodiesel
terminal
facilities
(Code
21


section
15G.204).
The
programs
are
supported
by
a
renewable
22


fuel
infrastructure
fund
(Code
section
15G.205).
23


The
bill
replaces
a
board
member
representing
the
Iowa
24


motor
truck
association
with
a
member
representing
the
Iowa
25


biodiesel
board.
The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
that
requires
26


the
reversion
of
moneys
credited
to
the
infrastructure
fund
to
27


their
originating
sources,
including
the
Iowa
comprehensive
28


petroleum
underground
storage
tank
fund
(2006
Iowa
Acts,
29


ch.

The
bill
appropriates
moneys
from
certain
fees
30


associated
with
motor
vehicles
that
are
currently
appropriated
31


to
the
Iowa
