a
plan.
The
bill
creates
an
individual
income
tax
credit
equal
1


to
the
lesser
of
25
percent
of
the
annual
contributions
made
2


to
an
Iowa
educational
savings
plan
or
$2,000
per

3


adjusted

to
reflect

In
order
to
qualify
for
the
credit,
a

taxable
6


income
must
not
exceed
300

The

In

16


may
elect
to
have
the
overpayment
shown

the
taxpayer’s
17


final,
completed
return
credited
to
the

the
18


following
tax
