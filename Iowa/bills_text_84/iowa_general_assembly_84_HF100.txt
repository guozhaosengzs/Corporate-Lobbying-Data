28


more

estate,
or
interest
in
real
property,
and
contracts
for
the

goods
or
services
under
circumstances
which
would

constitute
a
consumer
credit
transaction
as
defined
in
Code
9


section
537.1301
from
the
definition,
but
includes
door-to-door

The

states
that
a
service

may
not
contain
13


an
automatic

14

of
contract
18


renewal.

The
bill
provides
that
the

shall
also
24


provide
clearly
understandable
instructions
for
notification
by
25


the
consumer
to
the
service
provider
of
acceptance
of
contract
26


renewal.
The
bill
holds
a
service
provider
not
liable
for
27


cancelling
a
service
contract
if
no
notification
of
acceptance
28


was
received,
but
states
that
the
provider
shall
be
required
to
29


reinstate
the
contract
upon
submission
of
satisfactory
evidence
30


by
a
consumer
that
acceptance
was
in
fact
sent.
31


The
bill
provides
that
a

of
the

constitutes
a
