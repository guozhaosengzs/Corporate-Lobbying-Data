AN
ACT


RELATING
TO
PHYSICIAN
ORDERS
FOR
SCOPE
OF
TREATMENT.


BE
IT
ENACTED
BY
THE
GENERAL
ASSEMBLY
OF
THE
STATE
OF
IOWA:


Section
1.
LEGISLATIVE
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly


recognizes
the
importance
of
encouraging
individuals
to
discuss


and
make
health
care
decisions
before
a
situation
necessitates


an
actual
decision.
The
general
assembly
also
recognizes


that
health
care
planning
is
a
process,
rather
than
a
single


decision,
based
upon
the
individual’s
values
and
personal


health
status.
Advance
directives
provide
the
opportunity
for


an
individual
to
enunciate
and
document
the
individual’s
wishes


and
to
identify
the
person
authorized
to
make
decisions
for
the


individual
if
the
individual
is
unable
to
make
decisions.
The


general
assembly
recognizes
that
the
physician
orders
for
scope


of
treatment
form,
modeled
after
the
national
physician
orders


for
life-sustaining
treatment
paradigm
initiative,
complements


advance
directives
by
converting
individual
wishes
contained


in
advance
directives,
or
as
otherwise
expressed,
into
medical


orders
that
may
be
recognized
and
acted
upon
across
medical


settings,
thereby
enhancing
the
ability
of
medical
providers
to


understand
and
honor
patients’
wishes.
