defined
in
the
bill,
if
the

person
who

limits
the
adjustment
6


to
assessed
value
to
homesteads
that
have
certain
assessed
7


valuations
of
less
than
$150,000.
The
assessed
value
of
the
8


homestead
upon
which
property
taxes
are
levied
in
a
fiscal
9


year
is
the
same
assessed
value
as
for
the
previous
fiscal
10


year.
Assessed
value
is
that
value
prior
to
any
rollback
being
11


applied.
12


The
bill
provides
that
a
person
who
makes
a
false
affidavit
13


for

purpose
of
obtaining
an
adjustment,
knowingly
receives
14


the
adjustment
without
being
legally
entitled
to
it,
or
makes
15


claim
for
the
adjustment
in
more
than
one
county
without
being
16


legally
entitled
to
it
is
guilty
of
a
fraudulent
practice
and
17


is
subject
to
a
criminal
penalty.
18


The
bill
provides
that
the
provisions
of
Code
section
25B.7
19


requiring
the
state
to
fund
reimbursements
for
property
tax
20


credits
and
exemptions
do
not
apply
to
reductions
in
the
total
21


amount
of
property
taxes
due
under
new
Code
section
425B.5.
22


The
bill
applies
retroactively
to
January
1,
2011,
for
23


assessment
years
beginning
on
or
after
that
date
and
applies
to
