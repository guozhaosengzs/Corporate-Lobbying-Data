This
bill
requires
that
an
arbitrator
of
a
public
employee
21


collective
bargaining
agreement
consider,
among
other
factors,
22


a
comparison
of
wages,
benefits,
hours,
and
conditions
of
23


employment
of
the
involved
public
employees
with
those
of
24


private-sector
employees
doing
comparable
work.
The
bill
25


requires
an
arbitrator
making
that
comparison
to
strive
to
26


maintain
parity
in
wages,
benefits,
hours,
and
conditions
of
27


employment
between
the
public
sector
and
the
private
sector
for
28


comparable
types
of
work.
29


Current
law
requires
an
arbitrator
to
compare
wages,
hours,
30


and

employment
of
the
involved
public
employees
31


with
those
of
other
public
employees
doing
comparable
work.

The
bill
removes
the
requirement
that
an
arbitrator
consider
as
33


a
factor
the
ability
of
a
public
employer
to
finance
economic
34


adjustments
and
the
effect
of
such
adjustments
on
