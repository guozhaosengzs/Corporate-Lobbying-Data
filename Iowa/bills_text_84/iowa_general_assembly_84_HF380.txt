7

to
the

goods
3


retained
within
the
state
of
Iowa
and
federal
regulatory
4


authority.
5


The
bill
provides
legislative
intent
regarding
the
retention
6


and
delegation
of
powers
in
the
United
States
Constitution,
7


and
states
that
the
power
to
regulate
intrastate
commerce
is
8


reserved
to
the
states
or
the
people
under
the
ninth
and
tenth
9


amendments
to
the
Constitution.
The
bill
also
states
that
10


during
the

considered
11


and
rejected
a
plan
which
would
have
authorized
the
federal
