Findings
and

31


1.
The
general
assembly
finds
all
of
the
following:
32


a.
Technology
used
to
support
health-related
functions
is
33


widely
known
as
health
information
technology.
Electronic
34


health
records
are
used
to

health
information.
Electronic
health
records
serve
as
a
means
1


of
bringing
evidence-based
knowledge
resources
and
patient
2


information
to
the
point
of
care
to
support
better
decision
3


making
and
more
efficient
care
processes.
4


b.
Health
information
technology
allows
for
comprehensive
5


management
of
health
information
and
its
secure
electronic
6


exchange
between
providers,
public
health
agencies,
payers,
7


and
consumers.
Broad
use
of
health
information
technology
8


should
improve
health
care
quality
and
the
overall
health
of
9


the
population,
increase
efficiencies
in
administrative
health
10


care,
reduce
unnecessary
health
care
costs,
and
help
prevent
11


medical
errors.
12


c.
Health
information
technology
provides
a
mechanism
to
13


transform
the
delivery
of
health
and
medical
care
in
Iowa
and
14


across
the
nation.
15


2.
It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
use
health
16


information
technology
as
a
catalyst
to
achieve
a
healthier
17


Iowa
through
the
electronic
sharing
of
health
information.
A
18


health
information
network
involves
sharing
health
information
19


across
the
boundaries
of
individual
practice
and
institutional
20


health
settings
and
with
consumers.
The
result
is
a
public
21


good
that
will
contribute
to
improved
clinical
outcomes
and
22


patient
safety,
population
health,
access
to
and
quality
of
23


health
care,
and
efficiency
in
health
care
delivery.

It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
that
the
health

not
constitute

a.
After
applying
the
applicable
statutory
distribution
2


formulas
to
the
amounts
indicated
in
subsection
4
for
purposes
3


of
producing
preliminary

totals,
the

of
human

shall
apply
a
withholding
factor
to
adjust
5


an
eligible
individual
county’s
preliminary
distribution
6


total.
In
order
to
be
eligible
for
a
distribution
under
this
7


section,
a
county
must
be
levying
90
percent
or
more
of
the

maximum

allowed
for
the

11


for
which
the

is

12


b.
An
ending
balance
percentage
for
each
county
shall
13


be
determined
by
expressing
the
county’s
ending
balance
on
a
14


modified
accrual
basis
under
generally
accepted
accounting
15


principles
for
the
fiscal
year
beginning
July

2010,
in
the
16


county’s
mental

created
under
section
331.424A,
as
a
18


percentage
of
the

from

19


for

If
a

20


of
providing
services
from
the
county’s

fund
on

21


before
July

for

includes
the
loan
proceeds
or
an
23


amount
designated
in
the
county
budget
to
service
the
loan
for
24


the
borrowed
moneys,
those
amounts
shall
not
be
considered
25


to
be
part
of
the
county’s
ending
balance
for
purposes
of
26


calculating
an
ending

percentage
under
this
subsection.
27


c.
For
purposes
of
calculating
withholding
factors
and
for
28


ending
balance
amounts
used
for
other
purposes
under
law,
the
29


county
ending
balances
shall
be
adjusted,
using
forms
developed
30


for
this
purpose
by
the
county
finance
committee,
to

31


the

The

shall
be

from
the

amount
for

13


in

The

(1)
For

of

In

18


a

paragraph
shall
19


receive
an
inflation
adjustment
equal
to
3
percent
of
the
gross
20


expenditures
reported
for
the
county’s
services
fund
for
the
21


fiscal
year.
22


(2)
For
an

percentage
of
5
percent
or
more
23


but
less

a

factor
of
0

24


In

a

25


paragraph
shall
receive
an

equal
to
2
26

of
the

reported
for
the

for

(3)
For
an

percentage
of
10
percent
or
more
29


but
less

a

However,
for
counties
with
an
ending

of
10
percent
or
31


more
but
less
than
15
percent,
the
amount
withheld
shall
be
32


limited
to
the
amount
by
which
the

was
33


in

of
the

shall
be
equal

the

shall
adjust
the
7


withholding
factors
listed

as
necessary
to

achieve
the
target
withholding
amount.
However,
in
making
such

adjustments
to

factors,
the

strive
to
minimize
changes
to
the

factors
for
those

ending

percentage
ranges
that
are

and

shall
