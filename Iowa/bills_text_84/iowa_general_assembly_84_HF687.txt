EXPLANATION

This
bill
makes
changes
to
Code
chapter
357E
relating
to
21


benefited
recreational
lake
districts,
water
quality
districts,
22


and
combined
recreational
lake
and
water
quality
districts.
23


The
bill
specifies
that
districts
under
Code
chapter
357E
24


are
incorporated
as
public
entities.
25


The
bill
increases
from
three
to
seven
the
number
of
trustees
26


on
the
board
governing
a
benefited
recreational
lake
district,
27


water
quality
district,
or
combined
recreational
lake
and
28


water
quality
district,
other
than
the
two
trustees
who
may
29


be
appointed
by
the
natural
resource
commission
if
the
state
30


owns
a
certain
amount
of
land
contiguous
to
a
lake
within
the
31


district.
The
bill
makes
corresponding
changes
to
the
trustee
32


selection
procedure
for
newly
established
districts.
33


The
bill
also
provides
that

four
additional
trustees.
One
trustee
shall
be
appointed
to
1


serve
for
one
year,
one
for
two
years,
and
two
for
three
years.
2


Following
expiration
of
those
initial
appointments,
vacancies
3


are
filled
by
election.
4


Current
law
requires
trustees
to
be
residents
of
the
5


district.
The
bill
would
also
allow
property
owners
within
the
6


district
to
serve
as
trustees.
7


The
bill
amends
Code
section
357E.11,
relating
to
a
8


district’s
authority
to
issue
bonds
in
anticipation
of
revenue
9


to
specify
that
only
those
districts
that
are
not
combined
10


recreational
lake
and
water
quality
districts
may
issue
bonds
11


under
that
Code
section.
12


New
Code
section
357E.11A
authorizes
combined
recreational
13


lake
and
water
quality
districts
to
issue
bonds,
including
14


both
general
obligation
and
revenue
bonds,
in
the
same
manner
15


as
cities.
The
bill
provides
that
such
bonds
must
be
payable
16


at
the
place
and
be
of
the
form
designated
by
the
board
17


of
trustees.
The
bill
provides,
however,
that
a
combined
18


recreational
lake
and
water
quality
district
may
not
incur
19


an
indebtedness
until
authorized
by
an
election
where
60
20


percent
of
those
voting
on
the
proposition
vote
in
favor
of
the
21


proposition.
