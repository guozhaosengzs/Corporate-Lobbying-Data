EXPLANATION
19


This
bill
provides
a
credit
against
the
individual
or
20


corporate
income
tax,
the
franchise
tax,
the
insurance
21


premiums
tax,
and
the
moneys
and
credits
tax
for
20
percent
22


of
a
taxpayer’s
contribution
to
a
regenerative
medicine
23


research
institution
located
in
the
state.
Generally,
24


such
contributions
are
tax
deductible
under
current
federal
25


and
state
law,
and
taking
a
deduction
for
the
contribution
26


precludes
the
taxpayer
from
claiming
the
credit.
27


The
tax
credit
is
not
refundable
but,
at
the
taxpayer’s
28


election,
may
be
credited
to
the
taxpayer’s
tax
liability
for
29


up
to
four
subsequent
tax
years
or
until
depletion,
whichever
30


is
earlier.
The
tax
credits
are
not
transferable.
The
tax
31


credits
are
issued
on
a
first-come,
first-served
basis,
and
the
32


maximum
amount
of
tax
credits
is
limited
to
$10
million
in
any
33


one
fiscal
year.
The
department
of
revenue
approves
the
tax
34


credits
and
issues
the
tax
credit
certificates
to
taxpayers.
