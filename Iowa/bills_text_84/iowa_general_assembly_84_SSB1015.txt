15


Under
current
law,

exploitation
of
a
dependent
adult
as
a
result
of
the
willful
or
17


negligent
acts

omissions
of
a

when
the
caretaker
18


takes
unfair
advantage
of
the
dependent

physical
19


or
financial
resources
for
the
caretaker’s
own

by

harassment,
duress,

false
22


representation,
or
false

as
a
related
or
nonrelated
person
who
has
the
responsibility
24


for
the
protection,
care,
or
custody
of
a
dependent
adult
as
a
25


result
of
assuming
the
responsibility
voluntarily,
by
contract,
26


through
employment,
or
by
order
of
the
court.

The
bill
eliminates
the

that
a
caretaker
taking
28


unfair
advantage
of
a
dependent
adult’s
physical
or
financial
29


resources
must
do
so
for
the

or

pecuniary
profit.
