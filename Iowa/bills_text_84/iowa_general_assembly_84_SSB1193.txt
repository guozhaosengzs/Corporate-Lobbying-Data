modifies
provisions
applicable

administered
by
the
office
of
the
chief
information
officer
8


(OCIO)
under
Code
chapter
8B,
and
the
property
tax
exemption
9


for
broadband
infrastructure
provided
in
Code
section
10


427.1(40).
11


Current
law
requires
the
OCIO
to
administer
a
broadband
12


grant
program
to
award
grants
to
communications
service
13


providers
that
reduce
or
eliminate
targeted
service
areas,
14


as
defined,
by
installing
broadband
infrastructure
that
15


facilitates
broadband
service
at

above
25
megabits
per

second
of
download
speed
and
3
megabits
per
second
of
upload

speed
as
of
July
1,
2015.
The
bill
removes
references
to
the
18


specified
download
and
upload
speeds
and
date
throughout
Code
19


chapter
8B
and
instead
allows
the
OCIO
to
identify
such
speeds
20


and
date
by
rule,
which
the
OCIO
may
update
from
time
to
time
as
21


it
deems
appropriate.
The
bill
also
provides
a
new
definition
22


for
“facilitate”
in
Code
section
8B.1,
as
described
in
the
23


bill.
24


Current
law
allows
unencumbered
or
unobligated
moneys
25


remaining
in
the
broadband
grant
fund
at
the
close
of
the
26


fiscal
year
to
remain
available
for
use
until
the
close
of
the
27


succeeding
fiscal
year.
The
bill
instead
provides
that
such
28


moneys
shall
remain
available
until
three
years
following
the
29


last
day
of
the
fiscal
year
in
which
the
funds
were
originally
30


appropriated.
31


Current
law
requires
the
OCIO
to
evaluate
applications
for
32


broadband
grants
only
pursuant
to
the
information
provided
in

Current

Current
Code

provides

BACKGROUND.
Current
law
provides
that
the
workforce
housing
2


tax
incentive
program
(program)
administered
by
the
economic
3


development
authority
(authority)
makes
tax
incentives
in
the
4


form
of
investment
tax
credits
and
sales
and
use
tax
refunds
5


available
to
housing
businesses
that
complete
certain
housing
6


projects
in
Iowa.
In
order
to
receive
tax
incentives,
a
7


housing
business
must
apply
to
the
authority
and
have
its
8


housing
project
registered
by
the
authority,
and
then
must
9


enter
into
an
agreement
with
the
authority
(tax
incentive
10


agreement)
for
the
successful
completion
of
all
requirements
11


of
the
program.
Current
law
requires
a
housing
business
to
12


complete
its
housing
project
within
three
years
from
the
date
13


the
housing
project
is
registered
by
the
authority.
Upon
14


application
by
the
housing
business
prior
to
expiration
of
the
15


three
years,
and
at
the
authority’s
discretion,
a
one-time,
16


12-month
extension
may
be
granted.
If
the
housing
project
17


is
completed
and
properly
examined
by
a
certified
public
18


accountant,
and
all
other
requirements
of
the
tax
incentive
19


agreement
and
the
program
are
satisfied,
the
authority
may
20


issue
a
tax
credit
certificate
and
the
housing
business
may
21


claim
the
tax
incentives
for
which
it
qualifies
under
the
22


program.
Currently,
the
total
tax
incentives
issued
under
the
23


program
per
fiscal
year
cannot
exceed
$20
million.
Of
that
24


$20
million
annual
cap,
$5
million
must
be
reserved
for
tax
25


incentives
issued
to
housing
projects
located
in
small
cities,
26


as
defined
under
the
program.
The
program
also
limits
the
27


maximum
amount
of
tax
incentives
that
may
be
issued
per
housing
28


project
to
$1
million.
Current
law
requires
the
authority
29


to
issue
tax
incentives
under
the
program
on
a
first-come,
30


first-served
basis,
and
in
the
event
the
total
tax
incentives
31


for
all
registered
housing
projects
completed
in
a
fiscal
year
32


exceeds
an
annual
cap,
the
authority
is
required
to
maintain
a
33


wait
list
of
completed
housing
projects,
and
give
those
housing
34


projects
priority
for
being
issued
tax
incentives

subsequent

BILL
CHANGES.
The
bill
amends
current
law
relating
to
the
2


acceptance
of
housing
project
applications
by
the
authority.
3


Current
law
states
that
the
authority
may
accept
applications
4


on
a
continuous
basis.
The
bill
requires
the
authority
to
5


accept
applications
during
one
or
more
application
periods,
and
6


provides
that
housing
project
applications
shall
be
reviewed
7


and
scored
on
a
competitive
basis
by
the
authority
pursuant
to
8


rules
adopted
by
the
authority.
9


The
bill
removes
registration
of
housing
projects
from
the
10


program,
and
provides
that
the
authority
may
make
tax
incentive
11


awards
to
housing
projects.
Tax
incentive
awards
shall
be
12


subject
to
the
approval
of
the
director
of
the
authority.
13


Applicants
who
do
not
receive
a
tax
incentive
award
are
14


authorized
under
the
bill
to
make
additional
applications
for
15


that
housing
project
during
subsequent
application
periods.
In
16


determining
the
tax
incentive
award
of
a
particular
housing
17


project,
the
bill
prohibits
the
authority
from
using
an
amount
18


of
housing
project
costs
that
exceeds
the
amount
included
in
19


the
housing
project
application.
20


The
bill
requires
the
authority
to
notify
the
housing
21


business
of
its
tax
incentive
award.
The
notification
must
22


include
a
statement
that
the
housing
business
has
no
right
to
23


receive
a
tax
incentive
certificate
or
claim
a
tax
incentive
24


until
all
requirements
of
the
program
and
the
tax
incentive
25


agreement
are
satisfied.
26


The
bill
amends
the
requirements
related
to
the
tax
27


incentive
agreement
entered
into
by
the
authority
and
a
housing
28


business
to
provide
that
such
agreement
shall
identify
the
29


tax
incentive
award
amount,
the
tax
incentive
award
date,
the


30


project
completion
deadline,
and
the
total
costs
of
the
housing
31


project.
32


The
bill
provides
that
after
review
of
the
examination
of
33


the
housing
project
and
verification
of
the
qualifying
new
34


investment,
the
authority
may

business

7


The
bill
also
amends
the
definition
of
“small
city”
for
8


purposes
of
the
program.
Under
current
law,
the
definition
of
9


“small
city”
includes
any
city
or
township
not
located
within
10


the
11
most
populous
counties
in
the
state.
If
a
city
is
11


located
in
more
than
one
county,
it
is
considered
to
be
located
12


in
the
county
having
the
greatest
taxable
base
within
the
city.
13


Under
the
bill,
“small
city”
includes
any
city
or
township
14


not
located
wholly
within
one
or
more
of
the
11
most
populous
15


counties
in
the
state,
so
that
any
city
or
township
located
16


in
whole
or
in
part
in
one
of
the
88
least
populated
counties
17


in
Iowa
will
qualify
as
a
small
city
under
the
program.
The
18


definition
is
also
amended
to
provide
that
population
is
19


computed
using
the
most
recent
population
estimates
issued
by
20


the
United
States
census
bureau,
instead
of
the
most
recent
21


federal
decennial
census.
22


The
bill
amends
requirements
relating
to
the
termination
23


and
repayment
of
tax
incentives
for
failure
to
comply
with
24


the
requirements
of
the
program
to
provide
that
such
failures
25


to
comply
may
also
result
in
the
revocation
of
the
tax
26


incentive
award.
Current
law
provides
only
for
the
reduction,
27


termination,
or
rescission
of
an
approved
tax
incentive
for
28


failure
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
program.
29


The
bill
amends
language
relating
to
the
calculation
of
the
30


amount
of
tax
incentives
for
which
a
housing
project
qualifies.
31


Under
current
law,
the
amount
of
the
sales
and
use
tax
refunds
32


is
calculated
using
the
taxes
directly
related
to
a
housing
33


project,
and
the
amount
of
the
investment
tax
credits
is
34


calculated
using
a
percentage
of
the
qualifying
new
investment

apply

Housing
projects
registered
prior
to
July

shall
8


be
governed
by
current
law.
9


The
bill
provides
that
the
authority
shall
not
award
more
10


than
$25
million
in
tax
incentives
each
fiscal
year
beginning
11


on

$10

12


shall
be
reserved
each

for
tax

made
to

projects
located
in
small

For
housing
14


projects
registered
prior
to
July
1,
2019,
the
bill
states
that
15


a
tax
incentive
will
be
considered
awarded
when
the
authority
16


enters
into
a
tax
incentive
agreement
for
that
housing
project
17


as
provided
under
current
law,
and
the
bill
prohibits
a
housing
18


business
from
entering
into
a
tax
incentive
agreement
for
such
19


a
housing
project
until
the
authority
allocates
tax
incentives
20


to
that
housing
project
and
notifies
the
housing
business
that
21


the
authority
is
prepared
to
execute
a
tax
incentive
agreement.

The
bill
also
provides

no

2019,
until
the
housing
business
enters

The
bill
provides
two
exceptions

reservation
for
