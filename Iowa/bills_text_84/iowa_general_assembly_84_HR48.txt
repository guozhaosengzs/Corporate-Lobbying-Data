ARTICLE
I
16


By
unconstitutionally
exercising
functions
properly
17


belonging
to
the
legislative
and
executive
departments
18


as
follows:
19


(1)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Chief
Justice
20


Cady
improperly
assumed
the
function
and
role
of
an
21


elected
legislator
by
ordering
that
the
language
in
22


Iowa
Code
section
595.2
limiting
civil
marriage
to
a
23


man
and
a
woman
must
be
stricken
from
the
statute
as
24


enacted
by
the
legislative
department
and
approved
by
25


the
governor
of
the
executive
department
in
1998.
26


(2)
By

action
in

function
delegated
solely
and
exclusively
to
the
1


legislative
department
of
declaring
public
policy,
2


through
his
judicial
declaration
of
a
new
public
policy
3


contrary
to
long-standing
public
policy
acknowledged
4


by
society
and
established
in
Iowa
Code
section
595.2,
5


subsection
1.
6


(3)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Chief
Justice
7


Cady
has
improperly
required
the
executive
department
8


to
issue
marriage
licenses
to
parties
of
the
same
sex
9


in
direct
contravention
of
Iowa
Code
section
595.2.
10


(4)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Chief
Justice
11


Cady
has
created
a
constitutional
crisis
regarding
the
12


enforcement
of
the
Varnum
ruling
by
allowing
different
13


interpretations
of
the
definition
of
marriage
to
14


exist
indefinitely
within
the
separate
departments
of
15


government,
leaving
the
people
with
no
immediate
remedy
16


to
address
this
crisis.
17


(5)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Chief
Justice
18


Cady
has
created
a
constitutional
imbalance
and
19


confusion
within
the
State
of
Iowa
as
to
the
proper
20


constitutional
function
of
each
department,
thus
21


undermining
the
integrity
of
the
tripartite
separation
22


of
powers
among
the
departments
and
creating
social
23


disorder
and
unrest.
24


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED
BY
THE
HOUSE,
That
the
25


conduct
of
Supreme
Court
Chief
Justice
Mark
S.
Cady,
in
26


committing
malfeasance
in
office,
warrants
impeachment,
27


trial
by
the
Senate,
and
removal
and
disqualification
28


from
any
office
of
honor,
trust,
or
profit
under
the
29


state
pursuant
to
the
procedures
set
