requires
an
employer
to
provide
9


written
information
about
the

workers’
compensation
10


laws
to
an
employee
upon
receiving
notification
that
the
11


employee
has
suffered
a
work-related
injury.
The
employer
has
12


the
right
to
predesignate
a
licensed
physician
to
treat
the
13


injury
and
make
necessary
referrals
and
may
predesignate
a
14


physician
listed
on
the
state
registry
of
workplace
injury
care
15


providers.
If
the
employer
does
not
predesignate
a
treating
16


physician,
the
employee
may
designate
a
physician
of
the
17


employee’s
choosing
to
provide
the
treatment.
18


The
physician
predesignated
by
the
employer
or
designated
19


by
the
employee
is
required
to
provide
ongoing
written
20


documentation
of
the
physician’s
opinions,
treatment
21


recommendations,

care
plan
to
the

with
either
the

and

The
employee
has
the
right
to
request
and
obtain
29


a
second
opinion
from
another
licensed
physician
of
the
30


employee’s
choosing
at
the
employer’s
expense.
31


If
the
employer

employee
is
dissatisfied
with
the
care
32


of
a
treating
physician
predesignated
or
designated
by
the
33


other
party
or
with
any
referral
made
by
that
physician,
the
34


employer
and
employee
may
mutually
agree
to
alternate

either

compensation,
who
shall,
within
five
working
days,
schedule
3


a

between
the
parties
to
review
the
basis
for
4


dissatisfaction
and
provide
an
advisory
opinion
to
resolve
the
5


dispute.
If
the
parties
still
cannot
agree
on
alternate
care
6


after
this
conference,
the
workers’
compensation
commissioner
7


may,
upon
application
and
reasonable
proof
of
the
necessity,
8


allow

responsible
to
make
the
application
for
10


alternate
care
and
to
provide
such
reasonable
proof
to

not
act
as
described
23


above
or
if
the
employee
designated
the
treating
physician
to
24


treat
the
work
injury.
25


The
commissioner
is
not
bound
by
the
advisory
opinion
of
26


the
claims
specialist
and
must
conduct
a
hearing
and
issue
27


a
decision
within
10
days
of

reasonable
and
at
a
reasonable
