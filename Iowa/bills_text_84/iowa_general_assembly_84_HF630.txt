EXPLANATION
5


This
bill
prohibits
a
person
from
using
a
hand-held
6


electronic
device
to
engage
in
a
call
while
operating
a
motor
7


vehicle
unless
the
motor
vehicle
is
at
a
complete
stop
off
the
8


traveled
portion
of
the
roadway.
Pursuant
to
current
law,
9


“engage
in
a
call”
is
defined
as
talking
or
listening
on
a
10


mobile
telephone
or
other
portable
electronic
communication
11


device.
“Hand-held
electronic
communication
device”
is
defined
12


by
the
bill
as
a
mobile
telephone
or
other
portable
electronic
13


communication
device
capable
of
being
used
to
write,
send,
14


or
read
a
text
message
or
engage
in
a
call.
The
definition
15


excludes
voice-operated
and
hands-free
devices
and
devices
16


used
as
part
of
a
digital
dispatch
system.
A
device
which
is
17


temporarily
mounted
inside
a
vehicle
is
considered
to
be
a
18


hand-held
device
unless
it
is
a
voice-operated
or
hands-free
19


device.
20


The
bill
exempts
the
following
persons
from
the
prohibition
21


on
engaging
in
a
call
on
a
hand-held
electronic
device
while
22


driving:
a
member
of
a
public
safety
agency
performing
23


official
duties;
a
health
care
professional
in
the
course
of
24


an
emergency
situation;
and
a
person
receiving
safety-related
25


information
including
emergency,
traffic,
or
weather
alerts.
26


Like
the
existing
prohibition
on
texting
while
driving,
the
27


prohibition
on
engaging
in
a
call
on
a
hand-held
electronic
28


device
is
enforceable
only
as
a
secondary
action
when
a
driver
29


has
been
stopped
or
detained
for
a
suspected
violation
of
30


another
law.
The
bill
does
not
authorize
a
peace
officer
to
31


confiscate
a
portable
electronic
communication
device
from
a
32


driver
or
occupant
of
a
motor
vehicle.
33


The
penalties
for
engaging
in
a
call
on
a
hand-held
34


electronic
device
while
driving
are
the
same
penalties

H.F.

currently
applicable
for
texting
while
driving.
A
violation
1


is
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$30.
2


The
offense
is
not
a
moving
violation,
and
therefore
cannot
3


be
considered
for
purposes
of
administrative
suspension
of
a
4


driver’s
license
or
to
establish
habitual
offender
status.
5


In
addition,
if
a
violation
causes
a
serious
injury,
a
court
6


could
impose
an
additional
fine
of
$500
or
suspend
the
person’s
7


driver’s
license
for
not
more
than
90
days,
or
both.
If
the
8


violation
causes
a
death,
a
court
could
impose
an
additional
9


fine
of
$1,000
or
suspend
the
person’s
driver’s
license
for
not
10


more
than
180
days,
or
both.
11


The
bill
affects
motor
vehicle
operators
who
are
18
years
of
12


age
or
older
and
operators
who
are
17
years
of
age
with
a
full
13


driver’s
license.
Under
current
law,
all
other
motor
vehicle
14


operators
under
18
years
of
age
are
prohibited
from
using
an
15


electronic
communication
device
or
an
electronic
entertainment
16


device
while
driving.
