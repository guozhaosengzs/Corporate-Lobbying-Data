of
an
annual
oversize
8


vehicle
permit
for
the
movement
of
certain
combinations
of
9


vehicles
carrying
a
divisible
load.
Currently,
oversize
10


vehicle
permits
are
only
issued
for
vehicles
carrying
11


indivisible
loads,
except
under
special
or
emergency
12


circumstances.
13


The
bill
authorizes
the
department
of
transportation
14


to
issue
an
annual
all-system
permit
for
a
truck
15


tractor-semitrailer-semitrailer
or
a

16


tractor-semitrailer-trailer
combination
of
vehicles
carrying
17


a
divisible
load
to

on
certain
roads
which

part
18


of
the
national

of
vehicles
cannot

in
overall

semitrailer
or
trailer
in
the
combination
of
vehicles
may
be
up
23


to
45
feet
in
length,
and
the
load
on
each
individual
trailer
24


must
be
indivisible.
The
permit
allows
the
combination
of
25


vehicles
to
make
a
return
trip
unladen.
The
bill
specifies
26


that
the
fee
for
the
annual
permit
shall
be
established
by
the
27


department
by
rule.
28


Under
current
Iowa
law,
vehicle
size
limits
are
established
29


in
compliance
with
limits
established
by
the
federal
highway
30


administration
for
vehicles
traveling
on
the
national
network
31


of
highways.
The
national
network
is
made

of
interstate
32


highways
and
designated
portions
of
the
federal-aid
primary
33


system.

In
order
to
comply
with
the
federal
limit
on
trailer
length,
2


a
permit
issued
under
the
bill
allows
travel
only
on
highways
3


that
are
not
part
of
the
national
network.
State
permits
for
4


loads
exceeding
the
established
federal
width
limit
of
102

inches
are
permissible
under
federal
law.
6


Current
law
requires
the
use
of
escort
vehicles
to
accompany
7


certain
vehicles
of
excessive
size
and
weight.
A
vehicle
with
8


a
width
in
excess
of
14
feet
6
inches,
including
any
load
or
9


appurtenances,
is
required
to
have
an
escort
when
moved
on
10


a
two-lane
highway.
An
escort
is
not
required
for
movement
11


of
a
vehicle
with
a
width
not
exceeding
16
feet
6
inches
on
12


a
four-lane
highway
or
an
interstate,
provided
that
an

revolving
light
or
strobe
light
is
displayed
on
the
power
unit
14


and
on
the
rear
extremity
of
the
vehicle
or
load.
This
bill
15


allows
the
department
to
waive
the
escort
requirement
for
a
16


vehicle
with
a
width
not
exceeding
16
feet
to
be
moved
on
a
17


two-lane
highway
that
has
a
minimum
lane
width
of
12
feet
and
18


a
sufficient
shoulder
width.
The
vehicle
must
have
an
amber
19


revolving
light
or
strobe
light
displayed
on
the
power
unit
and
20


on
the
rear
extremity
of
the
