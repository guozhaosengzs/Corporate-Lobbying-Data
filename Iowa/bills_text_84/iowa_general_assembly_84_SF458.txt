EXPLANATION
21


This
bill
relates
to
gambling
establishments
within
the
22


state.
23


The
bill
would
allow
for
gambling
games
at
pari-mutuel
24


facilities
to
be
used
to
supplement
racing
purses
in
25


perpetuity.
Current
law
requires
that
such
supplements
end
26


before
2021.
27


The
bill
requires
that
the
Iowa
racing
and
gaming
commission
28


adopt
standards
for
the
length
of
the
thoroughbred
and
quarter
29


horse
racing
seasons,
so
that
the
thoroughbred
racing
season
30


be
not
less
than
67
days
in
duration
and
so
that
the
quarter
31


horse
racing
season
be
not
less
than
26
days
in

32


The
bill
requires
that
no
less
than
20
percent
of
all
net
33


purse
moneys
distributed
to
each
breed
must
be
designated
34


for
certain
purposes
to

the

breeding
industry.
The
bill
also
sets
requirements
for
the
1


proportionate
use
of
horse
purses,
so
that
76
percent
of
purse
2


funds
are
designated
for
thoroughbred
races,
15.25
percent
of
3


purse
funds
are
designated
for
quarter
horse
races,
and
8.75
4


percent
of
purse
funds
are
designated
for
standardbred
races.
5


The
bill
states
that
moneys
designated
for
standardbred
racing
6


can
only
be
used
to
support
harness
racing
at
county
fairs.
7


The
bill
also
prohibits
the
horse
racetrack
in
Polk
county
8


from
contributing
other
funding
for
such
racing
that
is
not
9


otherwise
provided
for
under
the
purse
structure
designations
10


of
the
bill.
11


The
bill
permits
advanced
deposit
wagering
for
pari-mutuel
12


licensees.
The
bill
would
allow
for
an
advanced
deposit
wager
13


to
be
placed
in
person
at
a
licensed
racetrack
enclosure
or
14


from
any
other
location
by
telephone
or
other
electronic
15


means.
In
this
form
of
wagering
an
individual
creates
an
16


account,
deposits
money
into
that
account,
and
can
use
the
17


balance
within
the
account
for
pari-mutuel
wagering.
The
bill
18


specifies
that
50
percent
of
the
revenue
from
advanced
deposit
19


wagering
be
distributed
to
certain
race
purses
and
the
other
50
20


percent
be
directed
to
the
licensee
for
the
pari-mutuel
horse
21


racetrack
in
Polk
county.
22


The
bill
would
prohibit
live
standardbred
horse
racing
23


by
the
licensee
for
the
pari-mutuel
horse
racetrack
in
Polk
24


county.
25


The
bill
eliminates
the
requirement
that
county
referenda
be
26


conducted
to
approve
the
continued
licensing
of
gambling
games
27


on
excursion
boats,
in
gambling
structures,
and
in
racetrack
28


enclosures,
and
makes
conforming
amendments.
29


The
bill
authorizes
the
creation
of
an
intrastate
internet
30


poker

and
provides
a

structure
for
its
31


implementation,
operation,
and
taxation.
32


The
bill
provides
that
it
may
be
cited
as
the
“Internet
