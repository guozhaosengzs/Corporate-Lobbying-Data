EXPLANATION

Under
current
Code
section
331.385,
a
county
may,
by
10


resolution,
assume
the
exercise
of
the
powers
of
township
11


trustees
relating
to
emergency
medical
service
for
any
township
12


located
in
the
unincorporated

of
the
county.
This
bill
13


allows
certain

based
on
population
limitations
to
14


provide
emergency
medical
service
for
all
incorporated
and
15


unincorporated
areas
of
the
county
if
each
city
located

whole
or

in
the
county,
except
those
cities
that
opt
17


out
under
the
bill,
each
township
in
the
county,
and
the
board
18


of
supervisors
enter
into
an
agreement
for
the
county
to
19


provide
emergency

20


The
bill
specifies
the

21


electing

emergency
medical

including
the
22

23


consisting

24


mayor
from
each
city

county
appointed
by
the
board
of
supervisors
who

27


operational

in
providing
emergency
28


medical
service.
The
emergency
medical
service
commission
is
29


responsible
for
submitting
a
transition
plan
to
the
board
of
30


supervisors
for
approval.
A

32


facilities,

other
available
resources
that

be
needed
by
the
county
to

emergency
34


medical
service,
