EXPLANATION
23


Current
law
allows
county
treasurers
to
accept
partial
24


payments
for
the
current
year
property
taxes
as
an
alternative
25


to
the
semiannual
or
annual
payment
of
property
taxes
under
26


Code
sections
435.24
and
445.36A.
This
bill
requires
county
27


treasurers
to
accept
such
partial
payments
and
requires
28


implementation
of
a
system
or
modification
of
the
current
29


payment
system
to
accept
monthly
payments
of
current
year
home
30


taxes.
31


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
32


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
33


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
34


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of

the

or

political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
2


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
