This

grant
program
for
first-time
entrepreneurs
administered

16


the
economic
development

The
bill
allows
a
local
economic
18


development
entity
to
apply
to
the

The
authority

not

economic
21


development

When

22

the
grant
program,
the
23


authority

the
entity’s
relationship

community,
the
organizational
status
of
the
entity,
or
other
25


information
the
authority

The

a
designated

27


development

of

32


The
bill
provides
that
a
designated
local
economic
33


development
entity
shall
establish
a
competitive-based
34


grant
application
process
for
first-time

A

awarded
under
the
bill
shall

$2,500
but

The

monitor
a
grant
7


recipient’s

by
8


requiring
documentation
of
the
use
of
the
award.
The
local
9


entity
shall
provide
the
documentation
to
the
authority.
The
10


bill
allows
the
authority,
with
the
assistance
of
a
designated
11


local
economic
development
entity,
to
seek
the
recapture
of
a
12


grant
pursuant
to
the
bill.
All
repayments
or
recaptures
and
13


interest
on
grants
awarded
shall
be
remitted
to
the
authority
14


and
deposited
in
the
entrepreneur
micro-assistance
fund.
15


The
bill
provides
that
a
first-time
entrepreneur
is
eligible
16


to
apply
for
a
grant

the
entrepreneur
intends
to
or

The
award
21


shall
only
be
used
for
utility
costs,
transportation
costs,
22


insurance
costs,

23


Once

grant,
the
bill
provides
24


that

of
the
funds
if

continue
to
meet
the
criteria
for
29


eligibility
or
the
entrepreneur
fails
to
use
the
awarded
moneys
30


as
required.
31


The
bill
also
creates
a
fund
for
the
entrepreneur
32


micro-assistance
grant
program.
The
fund
is
under
the
control
33


of
the
authority
and
