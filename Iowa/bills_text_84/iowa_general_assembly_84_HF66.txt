This

relates
to
the
custody-related
issues
of

27


of

military
personnel.
The

visitation,
a
parent
29


who
will
be
or

serving
active
duty
in
the
military
service
30


of
the
United
States,
may
petition

award
of
joint
31


physical
care
assigned
to
a
family
member
of
the
minor
child,
32


as
specified
by
the
parent.
As
with
assignment
of
visitation,
33


the
court
must
determine
that
the
assignment
of
the
award
of
34


joint
physical
care
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
