This
bill
establishes
a
livestock
environmental
assistance
1


revolving
fund
and
program
administered
by
the
agricultural
2


development
authority.
The
purpose
of
the
fund
and
the
program
3


is
to
allow
the
authority
to
enter
into
agreements
with
private
4


lenders
who
extend
commercial
loans
to
livestock
producers
5


for
the
purposes
of
constructing
structures,
or
installing
6


practices,
equipment,
or
systems
which
prevent
or
control
the
7


impact
of
a
livestock
operation
on
the
environment.
As
part
8


of
the
agreement,
the
authority
deposits
moneys
equaling
the
9


principal
amount
of
the
loan
with
the
lending
institution
in
10


return
for
a
certificate
of
deposit
earning
interest
at
a
rate
11


lower
than
the
market
rate.
The
moneys
from
the
certificate
of
12


deposit
are
to
be
placed
in
the
fund
on
maturity.
13


The
bill
appropriates
$15
million
to
the
fund
from
the
14


general
fund
of
the
state.
Moneys
in
the
fund
do
not
revert
to
15


the
general
fund
of
the
state
and
interest
earned
on
the
fund
16


remains
in
the
fund.
