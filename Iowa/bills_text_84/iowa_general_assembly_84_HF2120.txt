This
bill
raises
the
minimum
age
required
for
issuance
of
1


an
instruction
permit
to
operate
a
motor
vehicle
from
14
to
16
2


years
of
age.
Because
an
instruction
permit
is
required
for
3


a
student
to
participate
in
driver
education,
the
bill
amends
4


the
definition
of
“student”,
for
purposes
of
driver
education
5


provisions,
to
include
persons
between
16
and
21
years
of
age,
6


and
the
bill
raises
the
minimum
age
for
issuance
of
a
special
7


minor’s
license
to
drive
to
and
from
school
to
16
years
of
age.
8


Under
current
law,
a
person
who
has
an
intermediate
driver’s
9


license
under
the
graduated
driver
licensing
program
must
limit
10


the
number
of
passengers
in
a
motor
vehicle
operated
by
the
11


intermediate
licensee
to
the
number
of
passenger
safety
belts.
12


The
bill
imposes
a
further
passenger
restriction
by
prohibiting
13


an
intermediate
licensee
from
transporting
more
than
one
person
14


under
21
years
of
age,
other
than
an
immediate
family
member,
15


unless
the
intermediate
licensee
is
accompanied
by
a
licensed
16


driver
over
21
years
of
age.
17


The
bill
eliminates
the
full
driver’s
license
currently
18


issued
to
a
person
17
years
of
age
who
possesses
an
19


intermediate
license,
has
satisfied
hours-of-driving
20


requirements,
and
has
been
accident
and
violation
free
for
21


12
months.
Under
the
bill,
a
person
would
drive
under
an
22


intermediate
license
until
attaining
18
years
of
age.
