1.
The
department

the
department
of


public

and
the

shall
jointly


conduct
a
study
relating

or

with
an

to
conduct
such

study
under
the
joint


direction
of
the
departments.
The
study
shall
focus
on
the
use


of
cameras
mounted
on
school
buses
to
enhance
the
safety
of


children
riding
the
buses
and
to
aid
in
enforcement
of
motor


vehicle
laws
pertaining
to
school
bus
safety.
The
study
shall


also
consider
the
feasibility
of
requiring
school

picked
up
and
dropped
off
on
the
side
of
the
road
on

suspensions


for
conviction
of
a
first,
second,
or
subsequent

under
this
subsection
does
not,


by
implication
or
otherwise,
invalidate
any
prior
rulemaking


by
the
department
designating
certain
violations
as
serious


violations
and
does
not
preclude
future
rulemaking
by
the


department
to
designate
certain
violations
other
than

bus
safety.


5.

from
the
statutory
allocations


fund
to
the
department
of
transportation
an
amount
sufficient


to
fund
the
study
required
under
this
section
and
an
amount


sufficient
to
fund
the
development
and
programming
necessary
to


make
the
request
for
departmental
reexamination
form
available


through
the
Iowa
traffic
and
criminal
software.


Sec.
