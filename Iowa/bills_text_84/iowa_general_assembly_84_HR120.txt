every

with
8


an

never

WHEREAS,

COPD
became
the
third
leading

12


of

worldwide;
and
16

million
17


emergency
department
visits,
726,000
hospitalizations,
18


and
8
million
physician
office
and
hospital
outpatient
19


visits,
all
of

a
detriment

an
estimated
$49.9
billion
21


in
direct

22


WHEREAS,

in

and
1


WHEREAS,
the
American
Lung
Association
in
Iowa
is
2


implementing
the
Iowa
COPD
Strategic
Plan,
a
statewide
3


effort
to
increase
early
detection,
improve
care
and
4


treatment,
and
prevent
and
reduce
the
prevalence
of
the
5


disease;
and
6


WHEREAS,
research
has
identified
a
hereditary
7


protein
deficiency
called
Alpha-1
Antitrypsin
which
8


predisposes
people
to
developing
COPD,
even
without
9


exposure
to
smoking
or
environmental
triggers;
and
10


WHEREAS,
recently
the
death
rate
for
women
with
COPD
11


has
surpassed
the
death
rate
of
men
with
COPD,
with
12


women
over
the
age
of
40
being
the
fastest-growing
13


segment
of
the
population
developing
this
irreversible
14


disease,
due
in
large
part
to
the
equalization
of
15


opportunities
for
men
and
women
to
smoke
over
the
past
16


several
generations;
and
17


WHEREAS,
spirometry
testing
and
medical
treatments
18


exist
to
address
symptom
relief
and
possibly
slow
the
19


progression
of
the
disease,
but
there
is
currently
no
20


cure
for
COPD;
and
21


WHEREAS,
until
there
is
a
cure,
the
best
approaches
22


to
preventing
COPD
and
its
considerable
health,
23


societal,
and
mortality
impacts
lie
with
education,
24


awareness,
and
expanded
delivery
of
detection
and
25


management
protocols;
NOW
THEREFORE,
26


BE
IT
RESOLVED
BY
THE
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES,
27


That
the
