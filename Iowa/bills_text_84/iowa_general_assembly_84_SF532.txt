To
determine
the
amount
of
the
increase
in
sales
tax
revenue,
19


the
department
of
revenue
calculates
the
amount
of
sales

in
the
base
year
and

the

collected
during

quarter
in

of
revenue
23


then
subtracts
the
base
year
amount
from
the
amounts
in
the
24


subsequent
years
to
arrive
at
the
amount
of
the
increase.

department
of

in
the

for
each
27


governmental

use

credits
the
29


amount
of
the
governmental
entity’s
increased
revenues
to
the
30


governmental
entity’s
account.
However,
the
