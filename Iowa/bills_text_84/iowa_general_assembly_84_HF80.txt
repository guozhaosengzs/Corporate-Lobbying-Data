report.

1.
By
January
15
of
each
year,
the
department
may
submit
3


to
the
general
assembly
a
report
on
products
and
product
4


categories
that
when
generated
as
waste
may
be
appropriately
5


managed
under
a
product
stewardship
program.
The
report
should
6


include
proposed
changes
to
the
Code
necessary
to
implement
the
7


recommendations
in
the
report.
The
report
shall
not
consider
8


or
include
motor
vehicles
or
watercraft.
The
department
may
9


identify
a
product
or
product
category
as
a
candidate
for
a
10


product
stewardship
program
if
the
department
determines
one
or
11


more
of
the
following
criteria
are
met:
12


a.
The
product
or
product
category
is
found
to
contain
13


toxics
that
pose
the
risk
of
an
adverse
impact
to
the
14


environment
or
public
health
and
safety.
15


b.
A
product
stewardship
program
for
the
product
would
16


increase
the
recovery
of
materials
for
reuse
and
recycling.
17


c.
A
product
stewardship
program
for
the
product
would
18


reduce
the
costs
of
waste
management
to
local
governments.
19


d.
Other
states
or
countries
have
successfully
collected
and
20


processed
similar
products
under
product
stewardship
programs.
21


e.
Existing
voluntary
product
stewardship
programs
for
the
22


product
in
the
state
are
not
effective
in
achieving
solid
waste
23


reduction.
24


2.
At
least
thirty
days
prior
to
submitting
the
report
to
25


the

make

the

of
the

29


hearing.
The

shall
accept
both
