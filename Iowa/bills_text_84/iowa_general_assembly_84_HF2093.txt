IOWA
HOT
LUNCH
CHALLENGE
CAMPAIGN
——
LEGISLATIVE
1


FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
finds
all
of
the
following
2


information
demonstrates
the
need
for
the
Iowa
hot
lunch
3


challenge
campaign
created
by
this
Act:
4


1.
In
order
to
become
the
healthiest
state
in
the
nation
5


and
provide
a
world-class
education
for
our
children,
Iowa
must
6


improve
the
way
it
feeds
its
future.
7


2.
Nearly
thirty
percent
of
Iowa’s
school-age
children
are
8


eligible
for
free
or
reduced
lunch.
9


3.
One
in
five
Iowa
children
do
not
get
enough
food
at
home.
10


4.
Over
the
past
three
decades,
childhood
obesity
rates
in
11


the
United
States
have
tripled.
12


5.
Currently,
almost
one
in
every
three
children
in
this
13


nation
is
overweight
or
obese.
14


6.
In
September
2009,
the
federal
centers
for
disease
15


control
and
prevention
reported
there
were
no
states
meeting
16


national
goals
for
the
amount
of
fruits
and
vegetables
that
17


should
be
eaten.
18


7.
One-third
of
all
children
born
in
2000
or
later
will
19


suffer
from
diabetes
at
some
point
in
their
lives.
Many
others
20


will
face
chronic
obesity-related
health
problems
such
as
heart
21


disease,
high
blood
pressure,
cancer,
or
asthma.
22


8.
Iowa,
often
referred
to
as
the
world’s
breadbasket
and
23


home
to
many
of
the
nation’s
leading
food
and
nutrition
experts
24


and
the
world
food
prize,
is
well
positioned
to
be
a
leader
25


in
solving
the
issues
of
childhood
obesity
and
hunger
in
the
26


United
States.
27


9.
All
Iowans
can
play
a
role
in
preventing
childhood
28


hunger
and
obesity,
including
parents,
elected
officials
from
29


all
levels
of
government,
schools,
health
care
professionals,
30


faith-based
and
community-based
organizations,
and
private
31


sector
companies.
32


10.
Iowa
must
reduce
childhood
hunger
and
obesity
in
order
33


to
ensure
Iowa’s
children
do
not
grow
up
less
healthy
than
34


their
parents.

Because
the
state’s
schools
provide
a
key
community
1


access
point
for
children
and
families,
the
Iowa
hot
lunch
2


challenge
campaign
created
by
this
Act
is
intended
to
empower
3


students,
teachers,
schools,
and
communities
to
begin
working
4


together
to
make
this
state
a
national
leader
in
solving
the

problems
of
