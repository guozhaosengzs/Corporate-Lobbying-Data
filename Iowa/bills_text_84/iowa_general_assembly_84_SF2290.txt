BACKGROUND.
In
2010,
the
general
assembly
enacted
HF
20


2280
(2010
Iowa
Acts,
ch.
1030)
authorizing
the
department
21


of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship
(department)
to
regulate
22


commercial
establishments
that
possess
or
control
animals,
23


other
than
animals
used
for
an
agricultural
purpose
(Code
24


chapter
162).
A
commercial
establishment
includes
an
animal
25


shelter,
pound,
or
research
facility
which
must
be
issued
a
26


certificate
of
registration;
a
pet
shop,
boarding
kennel,
or
27


commercial
kennel
which
must
be
issued
a
state
license;
and
28


a
commercial
breeder,
dealer,
or
public
auction
which
must
29


be
issued
a
state
license,
but
may
be
issued
a
permit
if
30


federally
licensed.
All
of
these
documents
are
referred
to
31


as
authorizations
(Code
section
162.2A).
The
department
may
32


take
disciplinary
action
against
a
commercial
establishment
by
33


suspending
or
revoking
its
authorization.
34


RELINQUISHMENT.
The
bill
provides
that
a
commercial

establishment
may
relinquish
an

according
to

rules
adopted
by
the
department.
2


COMMERCIAL
BREEDERS
WHOSE
STATE
LICENSES
OR
PERMITS
HAVE
3


BEEN
REVOKED
OR
RELINQUISHED.
The
bill
provides
that
a
person
4


whose
state
license
or
permit
for
operation
as
a
commercial
5


breeder
was
revoked
must
comply
with
one
of
three
requirements.
6


First,
the
person
may
obtain
a
new
state
license
or
permit.
7


Second,
the
person
may
sterilize
the
dogs
or
cats.
Third,
8


the
person
may
reduce
the
number
of
dogs
or
cats
owned
by
the
9


person
or
in
the
person’s
possession
or
under
its
control.
10


The
reduction
may
be
accomplished
by
transfer
or
humane
11


destruction.
The
person
must
also
submit
a
statement
to
the
12


department
verifying
how
the
person
complied
with
the
bill’s
13


requirements.
Notwithstanding
the
sterilization
and
reduction
14


requirements,
the
person
may
keep
three
or
fewer
breeding
dogs
15


or
cats.
16


CIVIL
PENALTIES.
The
bill
provides
that
a
person
who
does
17


not
comply
with
the
compliance
requirements
is
subject
to
a
18


civil
penalty
of
not
more
than
$500
and
each
day
that
violation
19


continues
constitutes
a
separate
offense.
