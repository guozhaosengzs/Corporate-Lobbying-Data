1.
It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
that
on
or
28


before
October
1,
2013,
every
agency
having

roads
shall
30


develop
and
adopt
a
complete
streets
policy.
31


a.
The
policy
of
the
department
shall
explicitly
state
32


that
all
highway
projects
on
primary
roads
shall
ensure,
in
33


all
phases

and
development,
the
adequate
34


accommodation,

in
accordance
with
complete
streets
principles.
1


b.
The
policy
of
an
agency
other
than
the
state
shall
2


explicitly
state
that,
beginning
on
the
effective
date
of
3


the
policy,
all
highway
projects
on
roads
under
the
agency’s
4


jurisdiction
in
urban
areas
or
within
one
mile
of
the
corporate
5


limits
of
a
city
shall
ensure,
in
all
phases
of
project
6


planning
and
development,
the
adequate
accommodation,
safety,
7


and
convenience
of
all
users
of
the
road
in
accordance
with
8


complete
streets
principles.
9


2.
A
complete
streets
policy
shall
delineate
a
clear
10


procedure
by
which
an
agency
may
exempt
a
highway
project
from
11


the
requirements
of
a
policy
adopted
under
subsection
1
for
any
12


of
the
following
reasons:
13


a.
The
project
is
on
a
road
where
nonmotorized
travel
is
14


prohibited
by
law.
15


b.
The
cost
to
achieve
compliance
with
complete
streets
16


policy
would
be
excessively
disproportionate
to
the
need
for
or
17


probable
use
of
the
particular
road
as
a
complete
street.
18


c.
The
director
or
the
governing
body
recognizes
that
due
19


to
very
low
population
density
or
remote
location,
there
is
20


an
absence
of
present
or
future
need
for
the
development
of
a
21


complete
street.
22


d.
The
purposes
of
the
agency’s
complete
streets
policy
23


are
adequately
met
by
a
network
of
complete
streets
already
in
24


place
in
proximity
to
the
road
on
which
the
highway
project
25


will
take
place,
provided
that
the
existing
network
includes
a
26


route
for
all
users
of
the
road
that
reasonably
substitutes
for
27


the
route
followed
by
the
exempt
road.
