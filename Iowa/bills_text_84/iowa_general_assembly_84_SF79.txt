duty
or
similar
full-time

28


EXPLANATION
29


This
bill
relates
to
custody-related
issues
of
children
of
30


active
duty
military
personnel.
The
bill
provides
that
in
31


addition
to
assignment
of
court-ordered
visitation,
a
parent
32


who
will
be
or
is
serving
active
duty
in
the
military
service
33


of
the
United
States
may
petition
to
have
joint
physical
34


care
parenting
time
assigned
to
a
family
member
of
the
minor

S.F.
79


child
as
specified
by
the
parent.
As
with
the
assignment
of
1


visitation,
the
court
must
determine
that
the
assignment
of
2


joint
physical
care
parenting
time
is
in
the
best
interest
of
3


the
child.
The
bill
also
amends
the
best
interest
of
the
child
4


determination
by
the
court
to
provide
that
in
determining
the
5


best
interest
of
the
child
in
addition
to
factors
the
court
is
6


to
ensure,
the
bill
includes
that
the
specified
family
member
7


will
support
the
child’s
relationship
with
both
of
the
child’s
8


parents
during
the
assigned
visitation
or
joint
physical
care
9


parenting
time.
However,
the
bill
amends
the
current
factors
10


that
the
court
is
to
ensure
and
instead
requires
that
the
court
11


consider
whether
the
specified
family
member
has
a
history
of
12


domestic
abuse
and
whether
the
specified
family
member
has
a
13


record
of
founded
child
or
dependent
abuse.
14


The
bill
also
provides
that
an
order
granted
under
the
15


bill
may
temporarily
assign
visitation
or
joint
physical
care
16


parenting
time
that
is
equal
to
or
less
than
the
visitation
or
17


joint
physical
care
parenting
time
awarded
to
the
parent.
