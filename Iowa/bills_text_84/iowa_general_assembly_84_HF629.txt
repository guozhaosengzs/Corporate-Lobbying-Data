an

Entrapment
as
affirmative
defense.
a.
It
is
an
13


affirmative
defense
to
a
violation
of
subsection
1
that
the
14


employer
was
entrapped.
To
claim
entrapment,
the
employer
15


must
admit
by
the
employer’s
testimony
or
other
evidence
the
16


substantial
elements
of
the
violation.
An
employer
who
asserts
17


an
entrapment
defense
has
the
burden
of
proving
all
of
the
18


following
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence:
19


(1)
The
idea
of
committing
the
violation
started
with
law
20


enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
rather
than
with
the
21


employer.
22


(2)
The
law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
urged
and
23


induced
the
employer
to
commit
the
violation.
24


(3)
The
employer
was
not
predisposed
to
commit
the
violation
25


before
the
law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
urged
and
26


induced
the
employer
to
commit
the
violation.
27


b.
An
employer
does
not
establish
entrapment
if
the
employer
28


was
predisposed
to
violate
subsection
1
and
the
law
enforcement
29


officers
or
their
agents
merely
provided
the
employer
with
an
30


opportunity
to
commit
the
violation.
It
is
not
entrapment
for
31


law
enforcement
officers
or
their
agents
merely
to
use
a
ruse
32


or
to
conceal
their
identity.
The
conduct
of
law
enforcement
33


officers
and
their
agents
may
be
considered
in
determining
if
34


an
employer
has
proven
entrapment.
