chapter
321
to
be
15


moved

situation.
Instead,
the
bill
increases
the
width,
length,
17


and
height
restrictions
of
Code
chapter
321
for
vehicles
or
18


combinations
of
vehicles
transporting

or
bagged
livestock

Under
the
bill,
20


vehicles
and
combinations
of

22


allowed
to
be
moved
on
highways
so
long
as
such
vehicles
do
23


not
have
an
overall
width
exceeding
12
feet
5
inches,
an
24


overall
length
not
exceeding

is
a
simple
27


misdemeanor
