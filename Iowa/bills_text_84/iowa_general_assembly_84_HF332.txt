EXPLANATION
15


This
bill
requires
a
person
under
17
years
of
age
to
wear
16


a
safety
helmet
when
operating
a
motorized
bicycle.
The
bill
17


specifies
that
the
safety
helmet
must
meet
federal
standards
18


for
motorcycle
helmets
and
must
be
worn
by
the
driver
at
all
19


times
when
the
motorized
bicycle
is
in
motion.
20


Pursuant
to
current
law,
a
violation
of
motorized
bicycle
21


operating
requirements
is
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
22


scheduled
fine
of
$35.
23


In
addition,
a
violation
of
the
helmet
requirement
24


qualifies
as
a
moving
violation
and,
as
such,
is
grounds
for
25


cancellation
of
the
person’s
license
to
operate
a
motorized
26


bicycle.
A
person
whose
license
is
canceled
may
reapply
for
27


a
license
after
30
days.
If
the
person
who
violates
the
28


helmet
requirement
while
operating
a
motorized
bicycle
has
29


an
instruction
permit
or
intermediate
driver’s
license,
a
30


conviction
for
a
moving
violation
subjects
the
permittee
or
31


licensee
to
remedial
driver
improvement
action
and
may
be
cause
32


for
suspension
of
the
license
or
permit.
If
the
person
has
a
33


special
minor’s
license,
or
“school”
license,
a
conviction
for
34


a
moving
violation
is
grounds
for
license
suspension
at
the
