and

payment
collection.
10


Code
section
91A.2(6)
is
amended
to
limit
liquidated

11


to
twice
the
amount
of
unpaid
wages
rather
than
the
amount
of
12


unpaid
wages.
13


Code
section
91A.5
is
amended
to
provide
that
the
employer
14


has
the
burden
to
establish
that
a
deduction
from
employees’
15


wages
is
lawful
and
must
obtain
written
authorization
for
the
16


deduction
from
the
employee
in
advance.
17


Code
section
91A.6(1)
is
amended
to
remove
the

18


that
an

be
notified
by
the
division
of

services
19


of
the
department
of
workforce
development
before
the
employer
20


is
required
to

21


relating

employee
wage
and
benefit
information.
In

wages
are
earned.
Code
section
91A.6(1)(e)
is
amended
to
26


establish
a
rebuttable

not
maintain
proper
28


payroll
records.
29


Current

setting
out
certain

30


compliance
procedures,
is
stricken.
31


Code
section

4


paid
based
on
the
number
of

or

the
5

period.
An
employer
6


who
provides
an
electronic
statement
and
gives

free
7


and
unrestricted

to
the

is
in

the
Code
section.

In

section
91A.8,
when
any
specified
violation
of
Code

13


Code
section

under
Code
16


chapter
91A
with

employee.
A
90-day
period
is
17


established
during
which
any
action
against
an
employee
or
18


other
person
is
rebuttably
presumed
to
be
retaliatory.
New
19


subsection
6
is
created
in
Code
section
91A.10
to
allow
the
20


commissioner
or
any
injured
party
to
maintain
a
civil
action
in
21


any
court
of
proper
jurisdiction.
An
employer
who
retaliates
22


against
an
employee
or
other
person
shall
compensate
the
23


injured
party
an
amount
set
by
the
commissioner
or
the
court,
24


but
not
less
than
$150
for
each
day
of
the
violation.
25


In
new
Code
section
91A.15,
an
employer
shall
not
require
26


that
an
individual
be
a
current
employee
to
be
paid
an
earned
27


commission.
28


The
bill
takes
effect
January
1,
2012.
