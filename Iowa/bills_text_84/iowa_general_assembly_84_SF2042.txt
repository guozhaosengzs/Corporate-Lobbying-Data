The
intent
of
establishing
such
a
marketplace
is
to
reduce
1


the
number
of
uninsured
individuals
in
this
state,
provide
a
2


transparent
marketplace
and
consumer
education,
and
assist
3


individuals
with
access
to

premium
assistance
tax
4


credits,
and
cost-sharing
reductions.

For

bill,
a
qualified
employer
that

9


year
and
elects
to
make
its
full-time

10


employer’s
option,

A
qualified
employer
must
either
have

health
coverage
through
the
