SUBCHAPTER
VIII

Section
1.
NEW
SECTION


.
68A.801
Short
title
——
declaration

of
policy.
3


1.
This
subchapter
shall
be
known
and
may
be
cited
as
the
4


“Corporate
Political
Accountability
Act”
.
5


2.
The
general
assembly
finds
and
declares
as
follows:
6


a.
Although
corporations
cannot
vote,
corporations
make
7


significant
political
contributions
and
expenditures
that
8


directly
or
indirectly
influence
the
election
of
candidates
and
9


support
or
oppose
political
causes
at
the
federal,
state,
and
10


local
levels.
Decisions
to
use
corporate
treasury
funds
for
11


political
contributions
and
expenditures
are
currently
made
by
12


corporate
boards
and
executives,
often
without
the
knowledge
or
13


consent
of
shareholders.
14


b.
Corporations
acting
through
their
boards
and
executives
15


have
a
fiduciary
duty
to
conduct
business
in
the
best
interests
16


of
the
shareholders.
Corporate
boards
and
executives
that
use
17


corporate
funds
to
support
and
oppose
political
candidates,
18


political
parties,
and
political
causes
in
opposition
to
the
19


interests
of
many
or
all
of
their
shareholders
may
not
be
20


acting
in
the
best
interests
of
the
shareholders.
21


c.
Historically,
shareholders
of
corporations
in
the
United
22


States
have
not
had
a
way
to
know
of,
or
to
influence,
the
23


political
activities
of
corporations
they
own.
Shareholders
24


and
the
public
have
a
right
to
know
how
these
corporations
25


are
spending
their
funds
to
make
political
contributions
or
26


expenditures
benefiting
candidates,
political
parties,
and
27


political
causes.
28


d.
Corporations
should
be
accountable
to
their
shareholders
29


prior
to
making
political
contributions
or
expenditures
30


affecting
federal,
state,
and
local
governance
and
public
31


policy.
Requiring
the
express
approval
of
a
corporation’s
32


shareholders
prior
to
making
political
contributions
or
33


expenditures
and
requiring
reporting
to
shareholders
of
such
34


expenditures
will
help
establish
accountability.
