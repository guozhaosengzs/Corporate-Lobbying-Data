The

further
provides

the
holding

v.
Am.
Nat’l
Gen.
Ins.
Co.,
decided
by
the
Iowa
supreme
court

to
the
extent
that
case
expands
the

insurance
producer
to
a
client,
in
favor
of
prior
29


judicial
interpretation
as
described
in
the
bill.
30


In
the
Langwith
case,
the
Iowa
supreme
court
determined,
31


among
other
determinations
in
the
case,
that
its
previous
32


decisions
had
placed
unjustified
limitations
on
the
33


circumstances
that
might
be
considered
in
determining
the
34


duty
undertaken
by
an
insurance
producer
to
procure
insurance

for
a
client.
The
court
held,
among
other
holdings
in
the
1


case,
that
it
is
for
the
fact
finder
to
determine,
based
on
2


a
consideration
of
all
the
circumstances,
the
agreement
of
3


the
parties
with
respect
to
the
service
to
be
rendered
by
4


an
insurance
producer
and
whether
that
service
was
performed
5


with
the
skill
and
knowledge
normally
possessed
by
insurance
6


producers
under
like
circumstances.
