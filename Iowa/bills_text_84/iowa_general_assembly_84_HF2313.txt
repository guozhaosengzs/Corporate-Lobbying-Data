EXPLANATION
19


Under
current
law,
military
vehicles
which
are
retired
from
20


use
by
the
United
States
armed
forces
are
not
eligible
for
21


registration
and
titling
in
this
state
because
they
do
not
22


have
a
manufacturer’s
label
certifying
that
the
vehicle
meets
23


federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standards.
Although
federal
law
24


does
not
allow
the
application
of
the
manufacturer’s
label
on
25


military
vehicles,
some
of
those
vehicles
do
meet
federal
motor
26


vehicle
safety
standards.
This
bill
allows
the
department
27


of
transportation
to
register
certain
military
vehicles
that
28


were
manufactured
in
conformance
with
United
States
military
29


requirements,
other
than
a
vehicle
that
runs
on
continuous
30


tracks
or
wheels
and
tracks,
if
the
owner
provides
satisfactory
31


evidence
that
the
vehicle
is
substantially
in
compliance
32


with
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
standards.
The
department
33


is
authorized
to
adopt
rules
as
necessary
concerning
the
34


registration
of
military
vehicles.
