EXPLANATION

under
the
21


purview
of
the
department
of
public
health.
22


Division
I
relates
to
nursing
home
administrators.
The
bill
23


eliminates
certain
provisions
in
the
Code
chapter
that
are
24


duplicative
or
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
in
Code
chapter
25


147,
relating
to
health-related
professions
generally.
The
26


bill
eliminates
the
requirement
that
an
applicant
for
a
nursing
27


home
administrator
license
satisfactorily
complete
a
course
of
28


instruction
and
training
that
was
designed
and
administered
29


to
present
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
needs
properly
to
be
30


served
by
nursing
homes,
knowledge
of
the
laws
governing
the
31


operation
of
nursing
homes
and
the
protection
of
the
interests
32


of
patients,
and
knowledge
of
the
elements
of
good
nursing
home
33


administration.
The
bill
amends
Code
section
155.3
to
state
34


that
the
board
of

prescribes

pursuant
to
Code
section
147.34,
which
governs
1


the
examinations
required
for
licensure
for
health
care
2


professions,
rather
than
administering
the
exam
that
tests
3


for
competence
in
the
needs
properly
to
be
served
by
nursing
4


homes,
laws
governing

of

homes
and
the
5


protection
of
the
interests
of
patients,
and
the
elements
of
6


good
nursing
home
administration.
7


The
bill
adds
that
the
board
shall
license
nursing
home
8


administrators
in
accordance
with
the
rules
as
well
as
Code
9


chapters
147
and
155.
The
bill
makes
technical
changes
10


regarding
the
terminology
of
a
licensee’s
voluntary
or
11


involuntary
loss
of
license
and
refers
to
Code
section
147.55
12


for
revocation
of
a
nursing
home
administrator’s
license
while
13


eliminating
language
in
Code
section
155.4
subjecting
any
14


denial
of
issuance
or
renewal,
suspension,
or
revocation
under
15


Code
chapter
155
to
the
judicial
review
procedure
under
Code
16


chapter
17A.
17


The
bill
makes
technical
changes
to
the
licensing
fees
18


provision.
The
bill
allows
the
board
to
determine
the
19


multiyear
interval
in
which
a
license
shall
expire
and
allows
20


for
the
license
to
be
renewed
upon
payment
of
a
renewal
fee
21


rather
than
a
license
fee.
22


The
bill
provides
that
the
board
has
the
general
duties
23


and
responsibilities
for
health-related
boards
listed
in
Code
24


chapters
147
and
272C
and
strikes
the
board’s
specific
duties
25


relating
to
standards
to
be
met
by
individuals
in
order
to
26


receive
licenses
as
nursing
home
administrators;
techniques
for
27


determining
whether
an
individual
meets
the
required
standards;
28


the
issuance
of
and
disciplinary
actions
relating
to
licenses;
29


and
complaints
against
nursing
home
administrators.
The
bill
30


removes
language
allowing
the
board
to
conduct
a
continuing
31


study
and
investigation
of
nursing
homes
and
administrators
in
32


the
state
to
improve
the
standards.
The
bill
strikes
language
33

to
be

34


of

The
bill
retains
language
in
Code
section
155.9
that
allows
2


the
board
to
establish
rules
to
grant
a
provisional
license
to
3


an
administrator,
but
makes
technical
changes.
The
bill
allows
4


the
board
to
grant
a
provisional
license
to
an
administrator
5


appointed
on
a
temporary
basis
by
a
nursing
home’s
owner
6


if
the
regular
administrator
is
unable
to
perform
the
7


administrator’s
duties
or
the
nursing
home
is
otherwise
without
8


an
administrator
for
some
other
reason.
The
bill
strikes
a
9


provision
which
states
that
an
administrator
appointed
on
a
10


temporary
