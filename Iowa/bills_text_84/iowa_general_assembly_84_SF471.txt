An
agency
may,
on
its
own
motion
or
upon
3


request,
create
a
negotiated
rulemaking
group
if
the
agency
4


determines
that
a
negotiated
rulemaking
group
can
adequately
5


represent
the
interests
that
will
be
significantly
affected
by
6


a
draft
rule
proposal
and
that
it
is
feasible
and

7


in

Notice

the
creation
of
a
8


negotiated

group

2.
Unless
otherwise
provided
by
statute,
the
agency
shall
13


appoint
a
sufficient
number
of
members

the
group
so
that
14


a
fair
cross
section
of
opinions
and
interests
regarding
the
15


draft
rule
proposal
is
represented.
One
person
shall
be
16

The

28


the

shall
transmit
to
the

a
report
containing
the
29


consensus
on
the
draft
rule
proposal.
If
the
group
does
not
30


reach
a
consensus
on
a
draft
rule
proposal
within
the
specified
31


time
frame,
the
group
shall
transmit
to
the
agency
a
report
32


stating
that
inability
to
reach
a
consensus
and
specifying
any
33


areas

reached
a

in
order
to
assess
the
effects
of
such

The

shall
also
review
the
