the
Iowa

and

for
the
Iowa
teaching
standards
developed
by

department
in

accordance
with

subsection
46
.
These
standards
7


and
criteria
shall
be

The

or

,
evaluation

EXPLANATION
24


This
bill
eliminates
a
beginning
teacher’s
ability
to
appeal
25


termination
for
failure
to
demonstrate
competence
in
the
Iowa
26


teaching
standards,
and
a
nonprobationary
teacher’s
ability
to
27


appeal
if
discharged
for
just
cause.
Currently,
a
beginning
28


teacher
whose
contract
is
terminated
during
the
teacher’s
29


probationary
period
for
failure
to
demonstrate
competence
in
30


the
Iowa
teaching
standards
and
a
nonprobationary
teacher
who
31


is
discharged
for
just
cause
may
appeal
the
school
board’s
32


determination
to
an
adjudicator
or
to
the
district
court.
The
33


bill
also
strikes
language
that
specifies
the
training
that
an
34


adjudicator
selected
to
hear
an
appeal
must
complete.
