15


ARTICLE
I
16


By
unconstitutionally
exercising
functions
properly
17


belonging
to
the
legislative
and
executive
departments
18


as
follows:
19


(1)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Justice
20


Wiggins
improperly
assumed
the
function
and
role
of
21


an
elected
legislator
by
ordering
that
the
language
in
22


Iowa
Code
section
595.2
limiting
civil
marriage
to
a
23


man
and
a
woman
must
be
stricken
from
the
statute
as
24


enacted
by
the
legislative
department
and
approved
by
25


the
governor
of
the
executive
department
in
1998.
26


(2)
By
his
action
in
the

function
delegated
solely
and
exclusively
to
the
1


legislative
department
of
declaring
public
policy,
2


through
his
judicial
declaration
of
a
new
public
policy
3


contrary
to
long-standing
public
policy
acknowledged
4


by
society
and
established
in
Iowa
Code
section
595.2,
5


subsection
1.
6


(3)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Justice
7


Wiggins
has
improperly
required
the
executive
8


department
to
issue
marriage
licenses
to
parties
of
the
9


same
sex
in
direct
contravention
of
Iowa
Code
section
10


595.2.
11


(4)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Justice
12


Wiggins
has
created
a
constitutional
crisis
regarding
13


the
enforcement
of
the
Varnum
ruling
by
allowing
14


different
interpretations
of
the
definition
of
marriage
15


to
exist
indefinitely
within
the
separate
departments
16


of
government,
leaving
the
people
with
no
immediate
17


remedy
to
address
this
crisis.
18


(5)
By
his
action
in
the
Varnum
case,
Justice
19


Wiggins
has
created
a
constitutional
imbalance
and
20


confusion
within
the
State
of
Iowa
as
to
the
proper
21


constitutional
function
of
each
department,
thus
22


undermining
the
integrity
of
the
tripartite
separation
23


of
powers
among
the
departments
and
creating
social
24


disorder
and
unrest.
25


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED
BY
THE
HOUSE,
That
the
26


conduct
of
Supreme
Court
Justice
David
S.
Wiggins,
in
27


committing

in
office,
warrants
impeachment,

and
