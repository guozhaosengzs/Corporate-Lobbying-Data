and

28


agreement,
which
is
an
effort
to

of
the
sales
and
use
taxes
32


in
order
to
remain
in

seller
if
by
law
the
seller
may
but
is
not
required
to
collect

the
tax
from
the
consumer,
and
if
the
tax
is
separately
stated
2


on
the
invoice,
bill
of
sale,
or
similar
document
given
to
the
3


purchaser.

The
bill
further
amends
the
definition
of
“sales
price”
to
5


exclude
any
tribal
tax
on
a
retail
sale
that
is
imposed
on
the
6


seller
if
by
law
the
seller
may
but
is
not
required
to
collect
7


such
tax
from
the
consumer,
and
if
the
tax
is
separately
stated
8


on
the
invoice,
bill
of
sale,
or
similar
document
given
to
the
9


purchaser.
10


The
bill
allows
sellers
that
have
not
registered
under
the
11


streamlined
sales
and
use
tax
agreement
but
that

otherwise
12


registered
in
the
state
and
required
to
file
sales
tax
returns
13


to
elect
to
file
using
the
simplified
electronic
return.
14


The
bill
amends
Code
section
423.52
relating
to
liability
15


relief
for
sellers
and
certified
service
providers.
Under
16


current
law,
relief
from
liability
is
granted
to
sellers
and
17


certified
service
providers
who
charge
incorrect
sales
and
18


use
tax
after
relying
on
erroneous
tax
rate,
boundary,
or
19


jurisdiction
data
provided
by
the
state
in
databases
derived
20


from
zip
codes
or
addresses.
However,
the
state
may
deny
21


liability
relief
to
a
seller
or
certified
service
provider
for
22


reliance
on
either
database
as
long
as
the
state
maintains
an
23


address-based
system
for
assigning
taxing
jurisdictions,
and
24


provides
adequate
notice
to
the
affected
parties.
The
bill
25


provides
that
if
the
state
maintains
an
address-based
system
26


for
assigning
taxing
jurisdictions,
it
may
only
deny
liability
27


relief
to
sellers
and
certified
service
providers
for
errors
28


resulting
from
the
seller’s
or
certified
service
provider’s
29


reliance
on
a
database
derived
from
zip
codes.
