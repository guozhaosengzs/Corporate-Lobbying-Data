The

provides
that
a
person,
who
carries

type
or
in
a
manner
that
requires
the
person
to
hold
21


a
valid
permit
to
carry
weapons
under
circumstances
which
give
22


reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
person
is
intoxicated,
23


is
deemed
to
have
given
consent
to
the
withdrawal
of
specimens
24


of
the
person’s
blood,
breath,
or
urine
and
to
a
chemical
test
25


or

The

test
or
tests
shall
be
administered
at
the
written
request

to
believe
that
a
30


person,
who
carries
a

manner
31


that
requires
a

32


is

34


to

but
in
that
case,
the
peace
officer
shall
then
determine
which
1


one
of
the
other
two
substances
shall
be
tested
and
shall
offer
2


the
test.
If
the
peace
officer
fails
to
offer
a
test
within
3


two
hours
after
a
preliminary
screening
test
is
administered
or
4


refused
or
the
arrest
is
made,
whichever
occurs
first,
a
person
5


shall
not
be
required
to
submit
to
a
test.
If
the
peace
officer
6


has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
person
was
under
the
7


influence
of
a
controlled
substance,
a
drug
other
than
alcohol,
8


or
a
combination
of
alcohol
and
another
drug,
a
blood
or
urine
9


test
shall
be
required
even
after
another
type
of
test
has
10


been
administered.
Refusal
to
submit
to
such
a
chemical
test
11


of
urine
or
blood
shall
be
considered
a
test
refusal.
If
a
12


person
refuses
to
submit
to
chemical
testing,
a
test
shall
not
13


be
given,
and
the
peace
officer
who
requested
such
test
shall
14


document
the
refusal,
and
upon
such
refusal
to
test,
a
weapons
15


permit
issued
under
Code
chapter
724
shall
be
invalid.
16


The
bill
