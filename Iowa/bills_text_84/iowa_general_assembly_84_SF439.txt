or
upon

request,
create
a
negotiated

group
if

determines
that

negotiated
rulemaking
group
can
adequately
5


represent
the
interests
that
will
be
significantly
affected

a

and
that
it
is
feasible

2.
Unless
otherwise
provided
by
statute,
the
agency
shall
13


appoint
a
sufficient
number
of

that
14


a
fair
cross
section
of
opinions
and
interests
regarding

15


draft

proposal
is
represented.
One
person

28


the
group
shall
transmit
to
the

a

If
the
group
does
not
30


reach
a
consensus
on
a
draft
rule
proposal
within
the
specified
31


time
frame,
the
group
shall
transmit
to
the
agency

or

5.
Unless
otherwise
provided
by
statute,
following
a
6


negotiated
rulemaking
group
consideration
of
a
draft
rule
7


proposal,
the
agency
may
commence
rulemaking
as
provided
in
8


section

The

automatically
abolished

the
9


agencyâ€™s
adoption
of
the
rule
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
10


section
17A.5.

EXPLANATION
12


If
required
by
statute,
this
bill
requires
an
agency
to
13


create
an
ad
hoc
group
to
review
draft
rule
proposals
prior
14


to
commencing
a
rulemaking
proceeding.
Where
a
statute
does
15


not
require
this
review,
the
bill
allows
an
agency
to
create
16


such
a
review
group.
Members
are
appointed
by
the
agency
and
17


the
composition
must
adequately
represent
a
fair
balance
of
the
18


interests
affected
by
the
rule.
Once
such
a
group
is
created,
19


the
agency
may
only
commence
rulemaking
after
the
group
has
20


considered
the
draft
rule
proposal
in
question.
21


The
bill
is
based
on
similar
provisions
found
in
the
federal
22


Administrative
Procedures
Act.
