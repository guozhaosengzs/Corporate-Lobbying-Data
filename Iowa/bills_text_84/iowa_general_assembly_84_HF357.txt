H.F.

Section
1.

subsection
3,
Code

2


3.
To
authorize
upon
appeal
in
specific
cases
such

3

as
will
not
be
contrary
to
4


the
public
interest
,


and,
under
the
circumstances
appealed
5


from,
will
better
carry
out
the
intent
of
the
ordinance
and


6


comprehensive
plan
than
strict
adherence
to
the
ordinance


7


in
instances
where
owing
to
special
conditions
a
literal
8


enforcement
of
the
height,
bulk,
or
area
provisions
of
the
9


ordinance
will
result
in
practical
difficulties,
or
in
the
10


case
of
provisions
related
to
the
use
of
property,
when
an
11


unnecessary
hardship
,
and
so
such
that
the
spirit
of
the
12


ordinance
shall
be
observed
and
a
substantial
justice
done
13


injustice
would
occur
as
a
result
of
strict
adherence
to
the
14


ordinance
.
15


EXPLANATION
16


The
bill
modifies
the
authority
of
city
boards
of
adjustment
17


to
issue
variances.
18


Current
law
permits
the
board
of
adjustment
to
grant
a
19


variance
from
the
ordinance
in
the
event
that
such
a
variance
20


would
not
be
against
the
public
interest
and
is
necessitated
21


by
the
creation
of
an
unnecessary
hardship.
Such
a
variance
22


may
only
be
granted
in
the
event
that
the
spirit
of
the
zoning
23


ordinance
and
justice
can
be
maintained.
24


The
bill
would
require
that
a
board
of
adjustment
only
25


grant
a
variance
when
it
would
not
be
counter
to
the
public
26


interest,
and
when,
under
the
circumstances
appealed
from,
27


the
variance
would
better
carry
out
the
intent
of
the
zoning
28


ordinance
and
the
comprehensive
plan.
In
regard
to
height,
29


bulk,
and
area
restrictions,
the
bill
will
allow
the
board
to
30


authorize
a
variance
where
strict
compliance
would
result
in
31


practical
difficulties.
In
regard
to
the
use
of
property,
the
32


bill
will
allow
the
board
to
grant
a
variance
in
cases
where
33


strict
compliance
with
the
ordinance
would
create
a
substantial
34


injustice.
