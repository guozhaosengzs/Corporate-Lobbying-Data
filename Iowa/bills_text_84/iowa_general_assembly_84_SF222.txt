Purposes
and

of
charter
applications.
The

are
to
present
the
proposed
16


public
charter
school’s
academic
and
operational
vision
and
17


plans,
demonstrate
the
applicant’s
capacities
to
execute
the
18


proposed
vision
and
plans,
and
provide
the
authorizer
a
clear
19


basis
for
assessing
the
applicant’s
plans
and
capacities.
An

term
24


shall
commence
on
the
public
charter
school’s
first
day
of

delay
its
26


opening
for
one
school
year
in
order
to
plan
and
prepare
for

the
school’s
opening.
If
the
public
charter
school
requires
28


an
opening
delay
of
more
than
one
school
year,
the
school
must
29


request
an
extension
from
its
authorizer.
The
authorizer
may
30


grant
or
deny
the
extension
depending
on
the

public
31


charter

1


a.
Prior
to
any
public
charter
school
closure
decision,
2


an
authorizer
shall
have
developed
a
public
charter
school
3


closure
protocol
to
ensure
timely
notification
to
parents,
4


orderly
transition
of
students
and
student
records
to
new
5


schools,
and
proper
disposition
of
school
funds,
property,
and
6


assets
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
this
chapter.
7


The
protocol
shall
specify
tasks,
timelines,
and
responsible
8


parties,
including
delineating
the
respective
duties
of
the
9


school
and
the
authorizer.
In
the
event
of
a
public
charter
10


school
closure
for
any
reason,
the
authorizer
shall
oversee
and
11


work
with
the
closing
school
to
ensure
a
smooth
and
orderly
12


closure
and
transition
for
students
and
parents,
as
guided
by
13


the
closure
protocol.
14

In
the
event
of
a
public
charter
school
closure
for
any
15


reason,
the
assets
of
the
school
shall
be
distributed
first
16


to
satisfy
outstanding
payroll
obligations
for
employees
of
17


the
school,
then
to
creditors
of
the
school,
and
then
to
the
18


commission
for
transfer
to
the
treasurer
of
state
for
deposit
19


in
the

If
the
assets
of
the
school
20


are
insufficient
to
pay
all
parties
to
whom
the
school
owes
21


compensation,
the
prioritization
of
the

of
assets
22


may

EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
establishes
the
“Public
Charter
Schools
Act”,
and
3


creates
the
Iowa
public
charter
school
commission
as
a
public
4


charter
school
authorizer
oversight
body.
Local
school
boards,
5


accredited
public
and
private
postsecondary
institutions,
6


cities,
and
governing
boards
of
nonprofit
or
charitable
7


organizations
may
apply
to
the
commission
for
authorizing
8


ability.
The
bill
appropriates
$250,000
from
the
general
fund
9


of
the
state
to
the
commission
for
fiscal
year
2011-2012
for
10


purposes
of
administering
the
Code
chapter.
11


The
bill
includes
legislative
findings
and
declarations,
12


and
provides
for
the
establishment
of
virtual
public
charter
13


schools
that
will
offer
educational
services
predominantly
14


through
the
internet.
15


A
public
charter
school
shall
be
open
to
any
student
16


residing
in
the
state
and
may
limit
admission
to
students
17


within
a
given
age
group
or
grade
level
and
may
be
organized
18


around
a
special
emphasis,
theme,
or
concept
as
stated
in
the
19


school’s
application.
A
public
charter
school
must
enroll
all
20


students
who
wish
to
attend
the
school,
unless
the
number
of
21


students
exceeds
the
capacity
of
a
program,
class,
grade
level,
22


or
building.
The
bill
includes
provisions
for
enrollment
23


preferences
and
credit
transferability.
24


Eligible
public
charter
school
authorizers
are
responsible
25


for
soliciting
and
evaluating
charter
applications,
approving
26


quality
charter
applications,
declining
to
approve
weak
or
27


inadequate
charter
applications,
negotiating
and
executing
28


sound
charter
contracts
with
each
approved
public
charter
29


school,
monitoring
the
performance
and
legal
compliance
30


of
public
charter
schools,
and
determining
whether
each
31


charter
contract
merits
renewal,
nonrenewal,
or
revocation.
32


An
authorizing
entity
may
delegate
its
duties
to
offices,
33


employees,
and
contractors.
34


To
cover
authorizer
costs
for
overseeing

schools,
the
commission
shall
remit
to
each
authorizer
an
1


oversight
fee
for
each
public
charter
school
it
authorizes.
2


The
oversight
fee
shall
be
drawn
from
and
calculated
as
a
3


uniform
percentage
of
the
per-student
operational
funding
4


allocated
to
each
public
charter
school,
not
to
exceed
3
5


percent
of
each
public
charter
school’s
per-student
funding
in
6


a
single
school
year.
7


The
commission
consists
of
nine
members
serving
three-year
8


terms.
Five
members
shall
be
appointed
by
the
governor;
two
9


members
collectively
shall
be
appointed
by
the
president
and
10


minority
leader
of
the
senate;
and
two
members
collectively
11


shall
be
appointed
by
the
speaker
and
minority
leader
of
the
12


house
of
representatives.
The
commission
must
establish
the
13


annual
application
and
approval
process,
including
cycles
and
14


deadlines
during
the
fiscal
year,
for
all
entities
eligible
to
15


apply
for
chartering
authority.
The
commission
is
responsible
16


for
overseeing
the
performance
and
effectiveness
of
all
17


authorizers.
18


The
commission
shall
establish
a
statewide
formula
for
19


authorizer
funding,
which
shall
apply
uniformly
to
every
20


authorizer
in
the
state.
The
commission
shall
submit
the
21


formula,
and
any
succeeding
amendments
to
the
formula,
to
22


the
department
of
management,
the
general
assembly,
and
the
23


governor,
and
shall
provide
any
additional
information
required
24


by
the
department.
The
formula
shall
be
established
by
25


statute
prior
to
the
appropriation
or
distribution
of
state
26


funds
for
purposes
of
establishing
a
public
charter
school.
27


The
commission
may
establish
a
sliding
scale
for
authorizer
28


funding,
with
the
funding
percentage
decreasing
after
the
29


authorizer
has
achieved
a
certain
threshold,
such
as
after
30


a
certain
number
of
years
of
authorizing
or
after
a
certain
31


number
of
schools
has
been
authorized.
32


Funding
is
provided
through
the
school
district
of
33


residence,
as
the
enrollment
of
students
attending
public
34


charter
schools
must
be
included
in
the
enrollment,
attendance,

and,
if
applicable,
count
of
children
requiring
special
1


education
of
the
school
district
in
which
the
student
resides.
2


The
public
charter
school
shall
report
all
such
data
to
the
3


school
districts
of
residence
in
a
timely
manner.
Each

district
shall
report
such
enrollment,
attendance,
and
count
5


of
students
with
disabilities
to
the
state
department
of
6


education.
The
school
district
must
pay
directly
to
the
public
7


charter
school
for
each
student
enrolled
in
the
public
charter
8


school
who
resides
in
the
school
district
100
percent
of
the
9


amount
calculated
under
the
state’s
funding
formula,
and
any
10


categorical
funds,
for
that
student.
A
school
district
shall
11


pay
directly
to
a
public
charter
school
any
federal
or
state
12


aid
attributable
to
a
student
with
a
disability
attending
the
13


school.
14


Every
authorizer
is
required
to
submit
to
the
commission
15


and
the
general
assembly
an
annual
report.
Persistently
16


unsatisfactory

of
an
authorizer’s
portfolio
of
17


public
charter
schools,
a
pattern
of
well-founded
complaints
18


about
the
authorizer
or
its
public
charter
schools,
or
other
19


objective
circumstances
may
trigger
a
special
review
by
the
20


commission.
21


If
an
authorizer
granted
chartering
authority
persists,
22


after
due
notice
from
the
commission,
in
violating
a
23


material
provision
of
a
charter
contract
or
its
authorizing
24


contract
with
the
commission,
or
fails
to
remedy
other
25


identified
authorizing
problems,
the
commission
shall
notify
26


the
authorizer
that
it
intends
to
revoke
the
authorizer’s
27


chartering
authority
unless
the
authorizer
demonstrates
28


a
timely
and
satisfactory
remedy
for
the
violation
or
29


deficiencies.
30


To
solicit,
encourage,
and
guide
the
development
of
quality
31


public
charter
school
applications,
every
authorizer
must
32


issue
and
broadly
publicize
a
request
for
proposals.
Charter
33


applicants
may
submit
a
proposal
for
a
particular
public
34


charter
school
to
no
more
than
one
authorizer
at

S.F.
222


bill
includes
a
list
of
what
each
charter
application
must
1


include.
2


In
the
case
of
a
proposal
to
establish
a
virtual
public
3


charter
school,
the
request
for
proposals
for
applications
4


shall
additionally
require
the
applicants
to
describe
the
5


proposed
school’s
system
of
course
credits
and
how
the
school
6


will
monitor
and
verify
full-time
student
enrollment,
student
7


participation
in
a
full
course
load,
credit
accrual,
and
course
8


completion;
monitor

coursework;
conduct
parent-teacher
conferences;
11


and
administer

school
may
contract
with
an
14


education
service
provider
for
substantial
educational
15


services,
management
services,
or
both
types
of
services.
16


In
reviewing
and
evaluating
charter
applications,
17


authorizers
must
employ
procedures,
practices,
and
criteria
18


consistent
with
nationally
recognized
principles
and
standards
19


for
quality
charter
authorizing.
The
application
review
20


process
shall
include
thorough
evaluation
of
each
written
21


charter
application,
an
in-person
interview
with
the
applicant
22


group,
and
an
opportunity
in
a
public
forum
for
local
residents
23


to
learn
about
and
provide
input
on
each
application.
24


In
deciding
whether
to
approve
charter
applications,
25


authorizers
must
grant
charters
only
to
applicants
that
have
26


demonstrated
competence
in
each
element
of
the
authorizer’s
27


published
approval
criteria
and
are
likely
to
open
and
28


operate
a
successful
public
charter
school;
base
decisions
on
29


documented
evidence
collected
through
the
application
review
30


process;
and
follow
charter-granting
policies
and
practices
31


that
are
transparent,
based
on
merit,
and
avoid
conflicts
of
32


interest
or
any
appearance
of
conflicts
of
interests.
33


For
any
charter
denial,
the
authorizer
shall
clearly
state,
34


for
public
record,
its
reasons
for
denial.

shall
be
granted
for
a
term
of
five
3


operating
years.
4


The
performance
provisions
within
the

be
based
on
a
performance
framework
that
clearly
sets
forth
6


the
academic
and
operational
performance
indicators,
measures,
7


and
metrics
that
will
guide
the
authorizer’s
evaluations
of
8


each
public
charter
school.
The
performance
framework
includes
9


indicators
and
measures
for
student
academic
proficiency,
10


student
academic
growth,
achievement
gaps
in
both
proficiency
11


and

from

postsecondary
13


readiness,
financial
performance
and

and
board
14


performance
and

15


The
bill
provides
for
ongoing
oversight
and
corrective
16


actions.
Every
authorizer
is
authorized
to
take
appropriate
17


corrective
actions
or
exercise
sanctions
short
of
revocation
18


in
response
to
apparent
deficiencies
in
public
charter
school
19


performance
or
legal
compliance.
Such
actions
or
sanctions
20


may
include,
if
warranted,
requiring
a
school
to
develop
and
21


execute
a
corrective
action
plan
within
a
specified
time
frame.
22


A
charter
may
be
renewed
for
successive
five-year
terms
of
23


duration.
A
charter
contract
may
be
revoked
at
any
time
or
not
24


renewed
if
the
authorizer
determines
that
the
public
charter
25


school
commits
a
material
and
substantial
violation
of
any
of
26


the
terms,
conditions,
standards,
or
procedures
required
under
27


the

was
not
exempted.
33


Prior
