Section

NEW
SECTION
.
657.12
Actions
against
agricultural
1


uses
and
agricultural
practices.

1.
Legislative
purpose.
The
general
assembly
finds
3


that
development
in
rural
areas
and
changes
in
agricultural
4


technology,
practices,
and
scale
of
operation
have
increasingly
5


tended
to
create
conflicts
between
agricultural
and
other
6


uses
of
land.
The
general
assembly
believes
that,
to
the
7


extent
possible
consistent
with
good
public
policy,
the
law
8


should
not
hamper
agricultural
production
or
the
use
of
modern
9


agricultural
technology.
The
general
assembly
therefore
deems
10


it
in
the
best
interest
of
the
state
to
establish
limits
on
11


the
remedies
available
in
those
conflicts
relating
to
the
12


agricultural
use
of
land
which
reach
the
judicial
system.

EXPLANATION
18


This
bill
limits
the
right
to
bring
a
nuisance
action
19


involving
an
agricultural
use
or
agricultural
practice.
20


The
bill
includes
a
provision
declaring
the
importance
21


of
agricultural
production
and
use
of
modern
agricultural
22


technology.
The
bill
provides
for
agricultural
uses
and
23


practices
associated
with
those
uses,
which
include
a
range
of
24


activities
associated
with
crop
and
animal
production.
The
25


bill
provides
that
an
agricultural
use
or
practice
is
not
a
26


nuisance
under
two
conditions:
(1)
the
defendant’s
use
or
27


practice
predates
the
plaintiff’s
use;
and
(2)
the
defendant’s
28


use
or
practice
does
not
present
a
substantial
threat
to
public
29


health
or
safety.
The
conditions
apply
without
regard
to
30


whether
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
use
or
practice.
31


The
bill
provides
a
number
of
restrictions
upon
a
court
32


which
orders
relief
if
a
nuisance
is
found.
The
court
cannot
33


substantially
restrict
the
use
or
practice
unless
the
nuisance
34


is
a
substantial
threat
to
the
public
health
or
safety.
It
35


-3-

H.F.

must
consult
with
agencies
having
an
expertise
in
agricultural
1


matters.
It
must
provide
the
defendant
with
a
reasonable
time
2


to
take
the
action,
which
cannot
be
less
than
a
year.
Finally,
3


the
court
cannot
order
a
defendant
to
take
any
action
that
4


substantially
and
adversely
affects
the
economic
viability
of
5


the
agricultural
use,
unless
there
is
a
substantial
threat
to
6


public
health
or
safety.
7


The
bill
provides
that
if
the
defendant
in
such
a
nuisance
8


action
prevails,
the
court
must
award
the
defendant
litigation
9


expenses,
including
attorney
fees
and
fees
of
expert
witnesses.
