S.F.
_____


Political
subdivisions
may
continue
to
impose
any
existing
1


licensing
requirements
or
fees.
2


The
bill
also
limits
the
ability
of
licensing
authorities
3


to
refuse
to
grant
a
license
on
the
basis
of
an
applicant’s
4


criminal
record
by
requiring
licensing
authorities
to
5


specifically
list
the
offenses
that
disqualify
an
applicant
6


and
to
specifically
detail
the
grounds
for
disqualification
of
7


each
applicant.
A
licensing
authority
cannot
disqualify
an
8


applicant
for
an
arrest
not
followed
by
a
conviction
or
for
a
9


conviction
that
occurred
more
than
five
years
ago,
provided
10


that
the
offense
was
not
violent
or
sexual
in
nature,
or
based
11


on
a
finding
that
an
applicant
lacks
good
character
or
suffers
12


from
moral
turpitude.
13


A
disqualified
person
who
commits
an
additional
offense
14


during
the
period
of
disqualification
or
who
is
disqualified
15


based
on
a
violent
or
sexual
crime
may
not
be
disqualified
for
16


longer
than
five
years
following
release
from
incarceration.
17


An
applicant
who
is
denied
a
license
on
the
basis
of
a
criminal
18


record
is
entitled
to
an
administrative
review
and
any
review
19


in
civil
court
permitted
by
Code
chapter
17A.
The
licensing
20


authority
bears
the
burden
of
proof
in
such
proceedings.
21


The
bill
also
requires
licensing
authorities
to
respond
to
22


inquiries
as
to
whether
an
individual’s
criminal
record
would
23


disqualify
the
individual
from
obtaining
a
license.
24


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
25


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
26


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
27


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
28


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
29


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
30


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
31


The
bill
takes
effect
January
1,
2020.
The
bill
applies
32


to
all
licensing
decisions
made
on
or
after
120
days
from
the
33


effective
date
of
the
bill,
except
that
a
licensing
authority
34


may
implement
the
bill
on
an
earlier
date.
