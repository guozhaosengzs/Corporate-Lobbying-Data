Legislative
intent.

The
general
assembly
finds
that
investment
in
energy
2


conservation
measures
by
public
facilities
can
reduce
3


the
amount
of
energy
and
other
resources
consumed
by
the
4


facilities;
reduce
ongoing
operational
costs;
improve
comfort,
5


reliability,
and
the
indoor
environment
for
employees
and
6


citizens;
produce
a
positive
environmental
impact;
enhance
7


revenues
generated
by
governmental
units;
and
create
local
8


jobs,
producing
both
immediate
and
long-term
cost
savings
and
9


other
benefits.
It
is
the
policy
of
this
state
to
encourage
10


state
agencies,
departments,
and
divisions;
public
health
11


facilities;
public
universities
and
community
colleges,
12


school
districts,
and
area
education
agencies;
and
counties,
13


municipalities,
and
other
political
subdivisions
to
implement
14


energy
conservation
and
facility
improvement
measures
that
15


reduce
energy,
water,
wastewater,
or
any
other
utility
or
16


operating
costs,
and,
when
economically
feasible,
build,
17


operate,
maintain,
or
renovate
public
facilities
and
systems
18


in
a
manner
that
will
minimize
operational
costs
and
maximize
19


utility
savings
and
other
efficiencies.
It
is
additionally
the
20


policy
of
this
state
to
encourage
reinvestment
of
the
savings
21


and
revenues
resulting
from
energy
conservation
measures
into
22


additional
and
continued
energy
conservation
efforts
through
23


performance-based

If,

the

a

by
a
governmental
12


unit
requires
action
at
a

a
governmental
13


unit
may

if

in

In
such
a
