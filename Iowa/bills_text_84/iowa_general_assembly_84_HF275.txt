EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
raises
the
compulsory
school
attendance
age
from
3


16
to
18.
The
bill
requires
each
school
district
to
make
every
4


effort
to
prevent
students
from
dropping
out
of
school,
and
to
5


align
and
maximize
funding
streams
that
may
be
used
to
support
6


students
who
have
the
potential
to
drop
out
of
school.
7


The
bill
makes
a
corresponding
change
to
Code
section
299.1B
8


to
provide
that
a
person
who
reaches
age
18
after
September
15
9


is
ineligible
for
a
restricted
or
full
license
until
the
end
10


of
the
regular
school
calendar.
11


The
bill
includes
technical
amendments
to
eliminate
a
12


reference
to
the
compulsory
attendance
age
for
purposes
of
dual
13


enrollment.
14


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate

section

district

state
school
foundation
aid
received
by
the
18


school
district
under
Code
section
257.16.

specification
19


is
deemed
to
constitute
state
compliance
with
any
state
mandate
20


funding-related
requirements
of
Code
section
25B.2.
The
21


inclusion
of

is
intended
to
reinstate

requirement
of
political
subdivisions
to
comply
with
any
state
23


mandates
included
in
the
bill.
24


The
bill
takes
