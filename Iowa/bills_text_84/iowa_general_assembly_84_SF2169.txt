the

of
state.
The
bill
amends
Code
section
1


321A.25
to
provide
that
the
certificate
of
deposit
is
to
be
2


made
payable
to
the
department
of
transportation
and
filed
3


directly
with
the
department,
rather
than
with
the
treasurer
of

state.
The
bill
makes
conforming
amendments
to
the
definition
5


of
“financial
liability
coverage”
in
Code
section
321.1,
6


the
list
of
alternate
methods
of
filing
proof
of
financial
7


responsibility
contained
in
Code
section
321A.18,
and
related
8


provisions
in
Code
sections
321A.27
and
321A.29.
9


Code
section
321.196
is
amended
to
provide
that
when
the
10


department
renews
a
driver’s
license
electronically,
it
may
11


do
so
without
requiring
the
licensee
to
pass
a
vision
test
or
12


file
a
vision
report,
pursuant
to
rules
of
the
department.
The
13


bill
authorizes
the
adoption
of
emergency
rules
to
implement
14


this
provision.
The
amendment
to
Code
section
321.196
and
15


the
authorization
to
adopt
emergency
rules
are
effective
upon
16


enactment.
17


Under
current
law,
a
person
is
disqualified
from
operating
18


a
commercial
motor
vehicle
if
the
person
has
two
or
more
19


convictions
within
a
three-year
period
for
certain
specified
20


offenses
committed
while
operating
a
commercial
motor
vehicle
21


or
while
operating
a
noncommercial
motor
vehicle
and
holding
22


a
commercial
driver’s
license,
if
the
convictions
result
in
23


a
sanction
of
the
person’s
driving
privileges.
Code
section
24


321.208
is
amended
to
include
text
messaging
while
operating
a
25


commercial
motor
vehicle
as
one
of
those
specified
offenses.
26


Code
section
321.211
is
amended
by
striking
a
standing
27


$250,000
appropriation
to
the
department
intended
to
cover
the
28


cost
of
notice
and
personal
delivery
of
service
in
cases
of
29


driver’s
license
suspension.
The
bill
provides
that
license
30


reinstatement
fees
shall
be
used
to
help
defray
license
31


sanction
and
reinstatement
costs
rather
than
reimburse
the
32


department
for
the
costs
of
notice.
33


Code
section
321.257
is
amended
to
specify
the

or
a
flashing
yellow
arrow.
The
steady
red
arrow
prohibits
1


vehicular
traffic
from
entering
the
intersection
to
make
the
2


movement
indicated
by
the
arrow,
but
does
not
permit
entering
3


the
intersection
to
make
another
movement
permitted
by
another
4


signal
indicator.
A
flashing
yellow
arrow
means
vehicular
5


traffic
may
cautiously
enter
the
intersection
only
to
make
the
6


movement
indicated
by
the
arrow
or
another
movement
permitted
7


by
other
signal
indicators
displayed
at
the
same
time.
8


Traffic
operating
under
a
flashing
yellow
arrow
must
yield
the
9


right-of-way
to
other
vehicles
and
pedestrians
lawfully
within
10


the
intersection.
11


The
bill
strikes
current
provisions
in
Code
section
12


321.258
which
specify
the
arrangement
of
lights
on
official
13


traffic-control
signals.
The
provisions
are
replaced
with
a
14


requirement
that
the
design,
color,
and
arrangement
of
lights
15


on
official
traffic-control
signals
be
in
accordance
with
the
16


manual
on
uniform
traffic-control
devices,
which
is
published
17


by
the
United
States
department
of
transportation
and
adopted
18


by
rule
by
the
state
department
of
transportation
to
apply
to
19


highways
in
the
state.

DIVISION
II
——
VEHICLE
ENFORCEMENT.
Code
section
321.52
is
21


amended
to
require
the
department,
rather
than
the
Iowa
law
22


enforcement
academy,
to
train
and
certify
peace
officers
who
23


conduct
salvage
vehicle
theft
examinations.
The
$5
portion
24


of
each
salvage
theft
examination
fee
which
currently
accrues
25


to
the
Iowa
law
enforcement
academy
to
provide
salvage
theft
26


examination
training
and
certification
will
continue
to
27


accrue
to
the
academy.
The
department
is
authorized
to
adopt
28


rules
providing
for
electronic
completion
and
issuance
of
29


certificates
and
affidavits
along
with
electronic
payment
and
30


transfer
of
fees
in
connection
with
salvage
theft
examinations.
31


Code
section
321.105A
is
amended
to
provide
that
a
person
32


who
willfully
attempts
to
evade
payment
of
the
fee
for
new
33


registration
is
guilty
of
a
fraudulent
practice.
In
addition
34


to
the
criminal
penalty,
the

shall
be
assessed
a

of
75
percent
of
the
amount
of
the
fee
unpaid
and
required
to
be

paid.
These
are
the
same
penalties
that
currently
apply
for
2


making
a
false
statement
in
regard
to
the
purchase
price
of
a
3


vehicle
subject
to
a
fee
for
new
registration.
4


Code
section
321.200A
is
amended
to
modify
the
process
5


established
to
address
convictions
for
motor
vehicle
violations
6


that
are
based
upon
fraud.
The
term
“complaint”
is
substituted
7


for
“application”
to
describe
the
written
request
for
an
8


investigation
that
is
filed
with
the
department
by
a
person
9


alleging
that
a
record
of
conviction
for
a
scheduled
violation
10


was
entered
by
fraudulent
use
of
the
person’s
name
or
by
use
11


of
fraudulent
identification.
Under
the
complaint
process,
12


the
department
retains
its
existing
authority
to
accept
13


or
reject
a
person’s
request
for
an
investigation.
If
the
14


department
investigates
a
complaint,
it
must
provide
copies
of
15


the
report
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
the
city
or
county
16


that
prosecuted
the
scheduled
violation
and
to
the
applicable
17


district
court.
The
person
who
filed
the
complaint
is
entitled
18


to
receive
a
summary
of
the
department’s
investigative
report,
19


rather
than
a
certified
copy
of
the
full
report,
as
is
required
20


under
current
law.
21


Code
sections
321H.8
and
322.14
are
amended
to
align
penalty
22


provisions
for
vehicle
recyclers
with
those
of
motor
vehicle
23


dealers
and
to
lower
the
maximum
fine
for
a
simple
misdemeanor
24


violation
of
motor
vehicle
dealer
provisions.
Under
current
25


law,
a
person
convicted
of
violating
any
of
the
vehicle
26


recycler
provisions
contained
in
Code
chapter
321H
is
guilty
27


of
a
serious
misdemeanor,
and
a
person
convicted
of
violating
28


any
of
the
motor
vehicle
dealer
provisions
contained
in
Code
29


chapter
322
is
guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
30


a
fine
of
not
less
than
$250
and
not
more
than
$1,500
or
by
31


imprisonment
for
up
to
30
days.
The
amendment
provides
that
32


the
default
penalty
for
a
violation
under
Code
chapter
321H
or
33


322
is
a
simple

DIVISION

——
VEHICLE

CARRIER
SERVICES.
Code
2


section
321.40
is
amended
to
eliminate
the
requirement
that
the
3


title
number
from
a
vehicle’s
certificate
of
title
appear
on
4


the
registration
receipt
for

5


Code
section
321.116,
which
establishes
an
annual
6


registration
fee
of
$25
for
electric
motor
vehicles,
is
7


repealed.
As
a
result,
electric
motor
vehicles
will
be
subject
8


to
registration
fees
based
on
the
weight
and
value
of
the
9


vehicle.
The
change
applies
for
registration
years
beginning
10


on
or
after
January
1,
2013.
11


Code
section
321.166
is
amended
to
correspond
to
a
change
12


made
in
2011
legislation
eliminating
the
requirement
that
13


special
trucks
for
farm
use
be
issued
registration
plates
14


displaying
the
word
“special”.
15


Current
law
authorizes
the
department
to
issue
a
temporary
16


permit
allowing
a
motor
vehicle
dealer
to
display,
offer
for
17


sale,
and
negotiate
sales
of
new
motor
vehicles
at
fair
events,

vehicle
shows,
and
vehicle
exhibitions
held
in
the
county
where
19


the
dealer’s
principal
place
of
business
is
located.
The
bill
20


allows
such
a
permit
to
apply
to
fair
events,
vehicle
shows,
21


and
vehicle
exhibitions
held
anywhere
within
the
motor
vehicle
22


dealer’s
“community”
for
the
vehicles
displayed
or
offered
23


for
sale.
The
term
“community”
refers
to
the

franchisee’s
area
of
responsibility
as
stipulated
in
the
25


franchise
agreement.
26


Code
section
322.7A,
relating

must

Current

does
not

specify
