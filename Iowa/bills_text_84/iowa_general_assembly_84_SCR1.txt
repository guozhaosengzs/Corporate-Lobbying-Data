A
Concurrent
Resolution
requesting
the
United
States
1


Food
and
Drug
Administration
to
rescind
approval
of
2


ulipristal
acetate.
3


WHEREAS,
the
United
States
food
and
drug
4


administration
approved
ulipristal
acetate,
marketed
5


in
the
United
States
under
the
brand
name
“ella”,
on
6


August
13,
2010;
and
7


WHEREAS,
ella
was
approved
as
an
emergency
8


contraceptive
for
use
to
reduce
the
risk
of
pregnancy
9


up
to
five
days
after
unprotected
intercourse
or
10


contraceptive
failure;
and
11


WHEREAS,
even
though
ella
was
approved
only
as
an
12


emergency
contraceptive,
it
has
chemical
similarities
13


to
existing
drugs
such
as
mifepristone
(RU-486),
used
14


as
abortifacients;
and
15


WHEREAS,
the
potential
for
misuse
of
ella
as
an
16


abortifacient
could
result
in
unintended
abortions
and
17


put
women’s
lives
at
risk;
NOW
THEREFORE,
18


BE
IT
RESOLVED
BY
THE
SENATE,
THE
HOUSE
OF
19


REPRESENTATIVES
CONCURRING,
That
the
Iowa
General
20


Assembly
requests
that
the
United
States
food
and
drug
21


administration
rescind
its
approval
of
ella
based
upon
22


its
potential
use
as
an
abortifacient
rather
than
for
23


its
approved
purpose
as
an
emergency
contraceptive;
and
24


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
a
copy
of
this
25


resolution
be
sent
to
the
office
of
the
commissioner
of
26


the
United
States
food
and
drug
administration
and
each
27


member
of
Iowa’s
congressional
delegation.
