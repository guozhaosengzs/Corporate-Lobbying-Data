A
BILL

An

requiring
that
certain
housing
constructed
using
public
1


funds
incorporate
minimum
universal
design
standards

relating
to
accessibility.

ENACTED

Section

NEW
SECTION
.
104A.3
Minimum
universal
design
1


standards
——
accessibility.

1.
Findings.
The
general
assembly
finds
and
declares
3


it
is
the
policy
of
this
state
to
encourage
the
design
and
4


construction
of
affordable
homes
and
apartments
that
people
5


of
all
ages
and
abilities
can
independently
access,
enter,
6


and
visit.
Incorporating
universal
design
features
into
new
7


construction
dramatically
reduces
the
need
to
make
and
pay
8


for
home
modifications
that
address
accessibility
and
use
9


restrictions
related
to
aging
and
temporary
or
long-term
10


injury,
illness,
or
disability.
11

14


constructed

not
previously

15


or
nonresidential
form.
“New
construction”
does
not
include
the
16


alteration,
renovation,
