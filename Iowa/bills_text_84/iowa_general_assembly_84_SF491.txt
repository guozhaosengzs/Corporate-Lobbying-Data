EXPLANATION
21


This
bill
relates
to
the
child
abuse
registry
administered
22


by
the
department
of
human
services
and
addresses
when
founded
23


child
abuse
information
is
placed
in
the
child
abuse
registry.
24


Code
section
232.68,
providing
definitions
of
child
abuse
25


and
related
terms,
is
amended.
The
amendment
adds
to
the
26


definition
of
child
abuse
by
a
person
responsible
for
the
care
27


of
a
child,
the
person’s
failure
to
provide
adequate
medical
28


or
mental
health
treatment,
or
supervision
of
the
child.
The
29


definition
provision
addressed
by
the
amendment
is
commonly
30


referred
to
as
“denial
of
critical
care”.
Failure
to
provide
31


for
the
adequate
supervision
of
the
child
is
defined
to
mean
32


the
person
failed
to
provide
proper
supervision
of
a
child
that
33


a
reasonable
and
prudent
person
would
exercise
under
similar
34


facts
and
circumstances
and
the
failure
resulted
in
direct
harm

or
created
a
risk
of
harm
to
the
child.
1


Under
current
law,
denial
of
critical
care
is
limited
to
2


failure
to
provide
for
the
adequate
food,
shelter,
clothing,
or
3


other
care
necessary
for
the
child’s
health
and
welfare
when
4


financially
able
to
do
so
or
when
offered
financial
or
other
5


reasonable
means
to
do
so.
A
parent
or
guardian
legitimately
6


practicing
religious
beliefs
who
does
not
provide
specified
7


medical
treatment
for
a
child
for
that
reason
alone
is
not
8


considered
abusing
the
child,
however,
this
exemption
does
not
9


preclude
a
court
from
ordering
that
medical
service
be
provided
10


to
the
child
where
the
child’s
health
requires
it.
Although
11


the
religious
belief
exemption
is
not
affected
by
the
bill,
an
12


internal
reference
to
it
in
Code
section
232.71D
is
deleted.
13


The
bill
also
addresses
the
overall
definition
of
the
terms
14


“child
abuse”
or
“abuse”
by
providing
that
the
terms
shall
15


not
be
construed
to
hold
a
victim
responsible
for
failing
to
16


prevent
a
crime
against
the
victim.
17


Code
section
232.71D,
providing
criteria
for
whether
or
not
18


founded
child
abuse
information
is
placed
on
the
central
child
19


abuse
registry,
is
amended.
Current
law
provides
a
specific
20


list
of
abuses
for
which
there
is
no
discretion
and
must
be
21


placed
on
the
registry
and
describes
two
types
of
abuse
that
22


are
not
placed
on
the
registry
if
certain
determinations
are
23


made:
nonaccidental
physical
injury
or
injury
at
variance
with
24


the
history
of
it
and
the
denial
of
critical
care.
For
those
25


two
types
of
abuse,
in
order
not
to
be
placed
on
the
registry,
26


the
department
must
determine
that
the
injury
or
risk
of
harm
27


was
minor,
isolated,
and
is
unlikely
to
reoccur.
28


The
bill
removes
from
Code
section
232.71D
most
of
the
29


specific
provisions
requiring
registry
placement
and
instead
30


provides
a
specific
list
of
four
exemptions
that
if
any
of
31


the
circumstances
described
in
the
exemptions
are
applicable,
32


the
case
of
founded
child
abuse
is
not
placed
on
the
central
33


registry.
The
first
exemption
listed
is
similar
to
the
34


exemption
in
current
law:
a
finding
of
physical
abuse
in
which
35

S.F.

the
department
has
determined
the
injury
was
minor,
isolated,
1


and
unlikely
to
reoccur.
The
second
exemption
narrows
the
2


denial
of
critical
care
exemption
in
current
law
to
now
only
3


apply
to
failure
to
provide
adequate
supervision
or
failure
to
4


provide
adequate
clothing,
and
the
department
must
determine
5


that
the
risk
to
the
child’s
health
and
welfare
was
minor,
6


isolated,
and
unlikely
to
reoccur.
Under
the
bill,
abuse
7


resulting
from
other
forms
of
denial
of
critical
care
would
8


no
longer
be
exempted
from
placement
on
the
registry.
These
9


two
exception
clauses
do
not
apply
if
one
of
the
following
10


circumstances
is
also
applicable:
referral
of
the
case
for
11


criminal
or
juvenile
court
action,
the
same
perpetrator
was
12


previously
determined
to
have
committed
child
abuse
in
a
prior
13


case
that
occurred
within
the
preceding
18-month
period,
or
the
14


department
determines
the
alleged
perpetrator
will
continue
15


to
pose
a
danger
to
the
child
involved
with
this
case
or
to
16


another
child.
17


The
third
exemption
is
sexual
abuse
when
the
alleged
18


perpetrator
of
the
abuse
is
age
13
or
younger.
The
fourth
19


exemption
is
sexual
abuse
when
the
alleged
perpetrator
is
20


age
14
through
17
and
the
court
has
determined
there
is
good
21


cause
for
removing
the
name
of
the
alleged
perpetrator
from
22


the
registry.
In
such
cases
only
the
name
of
the
alleged
23


perpetrator
will
be
withheld
or
removed
from
the
registry.

Subsection
3
of
Code
section
235A.18,
relating
to
sealing
25


and
expungement
of
founded
child
abuse
information
from
the
26


registry,
is
stricken.
The
subsection
requires
the
department
27


to
review
cases
of
child
abuse
placed
in
the
registry
before
28


the
original
effective
date
of
Code
section
232.71D
of
July
29


1,
1997.
The
review
is
required
when
the
department
is
30


considering
the
information
while
performing
a
record
check
31


evaluation
under
law
or
administrative
rule
and
when
a
review
32


is
indicated
under
a
procedure
for
performing
reviews
adopted

by

is
amended
to
shorten
1


the
time
frame
within
which
the
subject

a

The
opportunity
for
the

for
an
evidentiary
hearing
5


is
changed
to
a
contested

hearing.
Current
law
allows
6


the
department
to
defer
the
hearing
until
the
conclusion
of
a
7


pending

or

case
and
the
bill

shortens
the
deferral
until
the
conclusion
of

phase
of

case.
10


The
department
is
required
to
continue
working
with
various
11


stakeholders
to
develop
and
implement
improvements
to
the
child
12


protection
system.
Implementation
is
required
for
near-term
13


solutions
that
can
be
implemented
without
legislation.
The
14


department
is
required
to
propose
options
to
address
long-term
15


issues
and
the
bill
lists
required
provisions.
A
report
is
16


required
to
be
made
by
December
15,
2011,
to
the
standing
17


committees
on
