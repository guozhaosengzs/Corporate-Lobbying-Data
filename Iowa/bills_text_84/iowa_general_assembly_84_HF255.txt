EXPLANATION
4


Under
current
law,
when
a
wrecked
or
salvage
vehicle
has
5


been
repaired,
the
vehicle
must
undergo
a
salvage
theft
6


examination
before
the
salvage
title
can
be
traded
for
a
7


regular
certificate
of
title.
Theft
examinations
are
performed
8


by
specially
trained
and
certified
peace
officers
for
the
9


purpose
of
determining
whether
the
vehicle
or
repair
components
10


have
been
stolen.
When
the
vehicle
is
presented
for
theft
11


examination,
the
owner
must
bring
along
the
salvage
title,
12


bills
of
sale
for
all
essential
parts
changed,
and
a
repair
13


affidavit
stating
that
the
vehicle
is
reasonably
safe
for
14


operation
and
listing
the
repairs
which
have
been
made
to
the
15


vehicle.
16


This
bill
expands
the
scope
of
the
theft
examination
to
17


include
inspection
of
repairs
made
to
the
vehicle
in
order
18


to
determine
that
the
vehicle
has
been
repaired
in
a
safe
19


manner.
The
examination
is
not
a
vehicle
safety
inspection,
20


and
a
salvage
theft
and
repair
examination
certificate
does
not
21


constitute
a
certification
that
the
vehicle
is
safe
to
operate.
