1.
a.
There
is
allowed
a
cow-calf
tax
credit
for
cow-calf
3


operations
located
in
the
state.
The
amount
of
the
tax
credit
4


equals
ten
cents
for
each
corn
equivalent
consumed
by
the
5


qualified
livestock
in
the
cow-calf
operation
as
specified
6


under
this
section.
The
tax
credit
shall
be
refunded
as
7


provided
in
section

8


b.
(1)
The
tax
credit
shall
be
available
to
an
individual
9


or
corporate
taxpayer
if
the
taxpayer’s
federal
taxable
income
10


is
not
more
than
ninety-nine
thousand
six
hundred
dollars
for
11


the
tax
year.
In
the
case
of
married
taxpayers,
their
combined
12


federal
taxable
income
shall
be
used
to
determine
if
they
13


qualify
for
the
credit.
14


(2)
For
each
subsequent
tax
year,
the
maximum
taxable
income
15


amount
specified
in
subparagraph
(1)
shall
be
multiplied
by
the
16


cumulative
index
factor
for
that
tax
year.
“Cumulative
index
17


factor”
means
the
product
of
the
annual
index
factor
for
the
18


2012
calendar
year
and

The
cumulative
index
factor
applies
to
all
tax
20


years
beginning
on
or
after
January
1
of
the
calendar
year
for
21


which
the
latest
annual
index
factor
has
been
determined.
22


(3)
The
annual
index
factor
for
the
2012
calendar
year
is
23


one
hundred
percent.
For
each
subsequent
calendar
year,
the
24


annual
index
factor
equals
the
annual
inflation
factor
for
that
25


calendar
year
as
computed
in
section
422.4
for
purposes
of
the
26


individual
income
tax.
27


2.
a.
The
amount
of
the
tax
credit
per
cow-calf
operation
28


is
determined
by
adding
together
for
each
head
of
qualified
29


livestock
in
the
cow-calf
operation
the
product
of
ten
cents
30


times
the
number
of
corn
equivalents
consumed
by
that
head
of
31


qualified
livestock.
The
amount
of
tax
credit
per
cow-calf
32

EXPLANATION
15


This
bill
restores
the
so-called
cow-calf
tax
credit
16


originally
enacted
by
the
general
assembly
in
1996
(1996
Iowa
17


Acts,
ch.
1197),
and
repealed
by
the
general
assembly
in
2009
18


(2009

Acts,
ch.
179).
The
bill
provides
for
a
tax
credit
19

a

operations
located
in
this
state
and
includes
20


a
standing
limited
appropriation
to
support
the
tax
credit.
21


The
bill
eliminates
other
livestock
operations
which
were
22


originally
part
of
the
statute
but
never
made
eligible
for
the
23


tax
credit
funding.
24


The
amount
of
the
tax
credit
is
computed
by
multiplying
a
25


designated
amount
by
the
amount
of
corn
equivalents
consumed
26


by
qualifying
livestock
($.10
x
111.5).
Qualifying
livestock
27


includes
mature
beef
cows
bred
or
for
breeding,
bred
yearling
28


heifers,
and
breeding
bulls.
A
taxpayer
must
have
a
federal
29


taxable
income
of
not
more
than
$99,600
for
the
tax
year.
The
30


amount
of
tax
credit
per
cow-calf
operation
cannot
exceed
31


$3,000.
The
tax
credit
is
available
to
an
individual
or
32


corporate
taxpayer
who
owns
qualifying
livestock.
33


The
amount
of
the
standing
limited
appropriation
is
$2
34


million
per
fiscal
year,
beginning
with
the
FY
2011-2012.
