20


EXPLANATION
21


This
bill
modifies
provisions
relating
to
the
regulation
of
22


delayed
deposit
services
businesses.
23


The
bill
deletes
current
provisions
prohibiting
delayed
24


deposit
services
licensees
from
charging
a
fee
in
excess
of
$15
25


on
the
first
$100
on
the
face
amount
of
a
check
or
more
than
$10
26


on
subsequent
$100
increments
on
the
face
amount
of
the
check
27


for
services
provided
by
the
licensee.
The
bill
substitutes
a
28


provision
prohibiting
imposition
of
a
finance
charge
in
excess
29


of
36
percent
per
annum
as
computed
pursuant
to
the
federal
30


Truth
in
Lending
Act,
times
the
face
amount
of
the
check.
The
31


bill
defines
“finance
charge”
to
mean
all
charges
payable
32


directly
or
indirectly
as
a
condition
of
a
delayed
deposit
33


service
transaction,
including
interest,
fees,
service
charges,
34


renewal
charges,
credit
insurance
premiums,
and
any
ancillary

product
sold
in
connection
with
a
delayed
deposit
service
1


transaction.
2


The
bill
provides,
with
respect
to
prohibited
acts
by
a
3


licensee,
that
a
licensee
may
not
engage
in
any
device
or
4


subterfuge
intended
to
evade
the
requirements
of
Code
chapter
5


533D,
including
but
not
limited
to
assisting
a
maker
of
a
check
6


in
entering
into
a
delayed
deposit
service
transaction
at
a
7


rate
of
interest
prohibited
pursuant
to
Iowa
law,
entering
into
8


transactions
disguised
as
personal
property
sales
and
leaseback
9


transactions,
or
disguising
amounts
received
pursuant
to
a
10


transaction
as
cash
rebates
for
the
pretextual
installment
11


sale
of
goods
or
services,
or
assisting
a
maker
of
a
check
12


in
entering
into
a
transaction
through
the
mail,
telephone,
13


internet,
or
any
other
electronic
means,
regardless
of
whether
14


the
licensee
has
a
physical
location
in
this
state.
The
15


bill
additionally
provides
that
a
delayed
deposit
service
16


transaction
entered
into
which
violates
the
Code
chapter
may
17


not
be
enforced
with
respect
to
a
maker
of
a
check,
that
any
18


payment
made
or
collected
in
connection
therewith
is
void,
and
19


that
the
licensee
does
not
have
the
right
to
collect,
receive,
20


or
retain
any
payments,
interest,
or
finance
charges.
21


Further,
the
bill
deletes
a
penalty
provision
authorizing
22


the
superintendent
of
banking
to
impose
a
civil
penalty
not
to
23


exceed
$5,000
per
violation.
The
bill
states
that
a
violation
24


of
the
Code
chapter
constitutes
a
consumer
fraud
pursuant
to
25


the
provisions
of
Code
section
714.16,
and
that
the
applicable
26


provisions
relating
to
investigation,
injunctive
relief,
27


and
penalties
shall
apply
to
Code
chapter
533D
unless
more
28


prescriptive
and
stringent
provisions
are
otherwise
specified
29


in
the
Code
chapter.
The
primary
effect
of
this
change
is
30


to
make
violations
subject
to
a
civil
penalty
pursuant
to
31


Code
section
714.16,
subsection
7,
in
an
amount
not
to
exceed
32


$40,000
per
violation,
and
in
addition
a
civil
penalty
of
33


not
more
than
$5,000
for
each
day
of
intentional
violation
34


of
a
temporary
restraining
order,

injunction,
