of
the
uniform
commercial
code
(UCC)
(Code
chapter
554,
1


article
9),
a
warehouse
lien
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
2


(Code
section
554.7209),
and
an
agricultural
lien
including
a
3


harvester’s
lien
(Code
chapter
571),
a
custom
cattle
feedlot
4


lien
(Code
chapter
579A),
a
commodity
production
contract
lien
5


(Code
chapter
579B),
and
a
veterinarian’s
lien
(Code
chapter
6


581).
7


BACKGROUND.
Under
Iowa’s
version
of
the
UCC,
article
9,
8


a
security
interest
is
created
by
a
contract
referred
to
as
9


a
security
agreement
executed
by
a
creditor
and
debtor
that
10


creates
a
financial
obligation
(Code
section
554.9201).
The
11


security
interest
attaches
to
the
debtor’s
collateral
(Code
12


section
554.9203)
and
based
on
that
agreement
the
creditor
13


may
perfect
the
security
interest
by
filing
a
financing
14


statement
with
the
secretary
of
state
(Code
section
554.9310).
15


Possession
is
also
a
means
to
perfect
a
security
interest,
16


including
general
warehouse
lien
allowed
under
the
UCC,
17


article
7
(Code
section
554.7209).
In
addition,
various
Code
18


chapters
existing
outside
the
UCC
create
agricultural
liens
in
19


commodities
produced
by
a
farming
operation.
An
agricultural
20


lien
is
a
statutory
lien
that
may
secure
the
payment
of
a
21


financial
obligation
associated
with
commodity
production,
and
22


is
not
necessarily
possessory,
meaning
that
it
may
continue
to
23


cover
the
commodity
after
harvest
and
delivery
(Code
section
24


554.9102(1)(e)).
However,
an
agricultural
lien
must
be
25


perfected
by
filing
a
financing
statement
with
the
secretary
26


of
state
(Code
section
554.9310).
Once
a
lien
is
created,
it
27


receives
a
degree
of
priority
over
the
covered
collateral
among
28


competing
creditors
seeking
to
enforce
a
debt.
Generally,
29


under
the
UCC,
article
9,
the
status
of
a
creditor’s
priority
30


is
based
on
the
date
of
the
security
interest’s
perfection.
31


However,
certain
statutes
outside
the
UCC,
article
9,
provide
32


a
special
status
to
lienholders,
including
those
holding
33


agricultural
liens.
34


APPLICABILITY.
The
bill
applies
to
leases
entered
into,
