the
8


special
registration
plates
issued

for

to

EXPLANATION
18


Under
current
law,
a
motor
truck
that
qualifies
for
a
19


business-trade
registration
fee
is
issued
registration
plates
20


which
are
specially
designed
to
distinguish
the
vehicle
as
a
21


business-trade
truck.
As
a
consequence
of
this
requirement,
22


the
owner
of
a
business-trade
truck
is
not
eligible
for
23


any
of
the
special
registration
plates
for
which
the
owner
24


might
otherwise
qualify.
This
bill
allows
the
owner
of
a
25


business-trade
truck
to
apply
for
and
display
any
of
the
26


special
registration
plates
instead
of
business-trade
truck
27


plates.
An
owner
who
chooses
special
registration
plates
is
28


responsible
for
the
regular
business-trade
truck
registration
29


fee,
plus
applicable
fees
required
for
the
special
plates.
