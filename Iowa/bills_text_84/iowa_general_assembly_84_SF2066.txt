EXPLANATION
14


Current
law
provides
that
a
court
shall
determine
the
amount
15


of
fees
to
be
awarded
to
an
expert
witness
in
a
civil
case
16


and
in
a
criminal
case
except
for
an
indigent
criminal
case
17


(Code
section
815.5),
upon
consideration
of
the
value
of
the
18


expert
witness’s
time
and
degree
of
learning
or
skill
required,
19


but
such
fees
shall
not
exceed
$150
per
expert
per
day.
This
20


bill
eliminates
this
limitation
on
the
fee
award
and
directs
21


the
court
to
also
consider
the
reasonable
and
customary
fees
22


charged
by
similarly
situated
experts
for
similar
services.
