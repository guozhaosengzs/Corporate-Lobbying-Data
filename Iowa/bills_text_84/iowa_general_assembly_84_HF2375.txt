standard
procedures
and
protocols
continue
to
be
scientifically
14


and
technologically
accurate
and
a
reliable
means
of
detecting
15


stray
current
or
voltage.
Other
measurements
of

EXPLANATION

This
bill
specifies
procedures
applicable
to
claims
5


asserting
stray
electric
current
or
voltage
impacting
dairy
6


cows.
7


The
bill
provides
for
the
adoption
of
administrative
rules
8


by
the
Iowa
utilities
board
establishing
standard
procedures
9


and
protocols
for
the
measurement
of
stray
current
or
voltage.
10


The
bill
directs
the
board
to
review
the
rules
periodically
11


to
ensure
that
they
remain
accurate
and
reliable
with
regard
12


to
stray
current
or
voltage
measurement,
and
provides
that
13


other
forms
of
measurement
may
be
considered
by
the
board
in
14


appropriate
cases.
The
bill
states
that
the
purpose
for
the
15


standard
procedures
and
protocols
shall
be
for
utilization
by
a
16


utility
in
taking
measurements
of
stray
current
or
voltage,
and
17


by
the
board
in
preparing
a
determination
of
source
document
18


that
may
be
utilized
by
either
a
dairy
producer
or
a
utility
as
19


evidence
of
the
source
and
level,
if
any,
of
stray
current
or
20


voltage.
The
bill
provides
that
the
determination
of
source
21


document
shall
be
based
on
qualified,
measureable,
scientific
22


facts,
and
that
neither
the
board,
nor
the
document,
shall
23


establish
liability
or
civil
damages
in
connection
with
a
civil
24


lawsuit.
25


The
bill
provides
that
a
dairy
producer
in
Iowa
who
claims
26


that
its
dairy
cows
are
being
affected
by
stray
current
or
27


voltage
may
participate
in
a
stray
voltage
program
by
providing
28


written
notice
to
the
utility
and,
optionally,
to
the
board
29


containing
a
nonbinding
statement
as
to
why
the
dairy
producer
30


believes
its
dairy
cows
are
being
affected
by
electrical
energy
31


attributable
to
the
utility.
32


Within
14
business
days
after
receipt
of
the
notice,
the
33


bill
requires
the
utility
to
take
or
arrange
for
the
taking
34

if
any.
The
bill
prohibits
the
1


utility
from
performing
any
other
service
or
inspection
on
the
2


dairy
farm
beyond
taking
the
measurements
other
than
advising
3


the
dairy
producer
as
to
recommended
on-farm
remedial
action
4


and
performing
such
remedial
action
with
permission.
The
bill
5


provides
that
the
utility
or
its
representative
shall
abide
by
6


the
dairy
farm’s
biosecurity
protocols,
or
if
none,
generally
7


accepted
biosecurity
protocols
in
the
industry
prior
to
entry
8


onto
the
dairy
farm,
and
requires
the
dairy
producer
to
provide
9


advance
notice
of
any
biosecurity
protocols
they
have
adopted
10


to
the
utility.
11


The
bill
provides
that
a
dairy
producer,
or
a
utility,
12


may
request
that
the
board
take
or
arrange

the
taking
13


of

to
identity
the

any,
either
directly
or
by
a
neutral
third-party
expert
16


selected
by
the
board
for
such
purposes.
The
bill
applies
17


the
same
restrictions
regarding
performing
no
other
service
18


or
inspection
and
abiding
by
biosecurity
protocols
as
are
19


applicable
to
measurements
taken
by
the
utility.
After
20


measurements
are
taken
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
board,
the
board
21


must
prepare
or
cause
to
be
prepared
the
determination
of
22


source
document
and
make
the
document
available
to
both
the
23


dairy
producer
and
the
utility.
24


The
bill
states
that
if
the
utility
or
the
board’s
25


measurements
identify
a
level
of
stray
current
or
voltage
at
26


cow

points
in

of
the
preventive
action
level,
as
27


defined
in
the

the
utility
or
the
board,
as
applicable,
28


shall
promptly
identify
if
the
utility’s
distribution
system’s
29


contribution
is
greater
than
one
milliamp

For
30


purposes
of
this
determination,
the
bill
provides
that
stray
