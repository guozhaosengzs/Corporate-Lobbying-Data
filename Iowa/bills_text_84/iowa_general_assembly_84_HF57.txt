EXPLANATION
28


This
bill
relates
to
the
assessment
of
penalties
and
29


interest
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
sales
and
use
tax
laws
30


in
certain
circumstances.
31


Currently,
if
a
person
fails
to
file
a
return
or
deposit
32


form
with
the
department
of
revenue
when
required
to
do
so
or
33


fails
to
timely
pay
the
taxes
due,
the
department
shall
assess
34


a
penalty
under
Code
section
421.27.
The
department
can
only
35

H.F.

waive
the
penalty
if
certain
statutory
conditions
are
met.
1


The
bill
gives
the
department
the
discretion
to
waive
the
2


penalty,
and
any
applicable
interest
pursuant
to
Code
section
3


423.40,
for
certain
taxpayers
who
fail
to
file
the
required
4


returns
or
to
timely
pay
the
taxes
due.
Specifically,
because
5


the
use
tax,
if
owed,
is
due
until
it
is
paid,
under
certain
6


circumstances,
it
may
be
owed
by
a
subsequent
purchaser
of
7


tangible
personal
property
because
of
a
prior
purchaser’s
8


failure
to
pay
it.
The
bill
allows
the
department
to
waive
9


the
penalty
for
both
a
failure
to
file
a
return
and
a
failure
10


to
timely
pay
the
taxes
due
if
the
taxpayer
is
a
subsequent
11


purchaser
who
was
unaware
of
a
prior
purchaser’s
failure
to
pay
12


the
tax.
13


The
bill
allows
refunds
of
past
penalties
and
interest
14


but
limits
them
to
$50,000
in
the
aggregate
and
to
claims
15


for
refund
filed
prior
to
October
1,
2011.
If
the
amount
of
16


such
claims
is
in
excess
of
that
amount,
the
department
is
to
17


prorate
the
refunds.
18


The
bill
is
effective
upon
enactment
and
applies
19


retroactively
to
January
1,
2009,
for
the
assessment
of
20


interest
or
penalties
on
or
after
that
date.
