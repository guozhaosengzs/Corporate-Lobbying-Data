universal
credentialing

the

process
consistent

The
bill
also
changes
the
definition
of
“credentialing”

to
include
a

Corresponding
changes
are
made

“Credentialing”
is
now
defined

a
credentialing
entity
makes
a

11


based
on
criteria
established
by
the
credentialing
entity
12


concerning
whether
a
physician,
advanced
registered
nurse
13


practitioner,
physician
assistant,
or
other
health
care
14


practitioner
is
eligible
to
provide
health
care
services
to
15


a
patient

practitioner,
18


physician
assistant,
or
other
health
care
practitioner,
and
the
19


credentialing
entity.
20


The
bill
also
adds
definitions
of
“health
insurer”
and
21


“hospital”
and
reorganizes
all
the
definitions
in
the
Code
22


section
so
that
they
are
in
alphabetical
order.
