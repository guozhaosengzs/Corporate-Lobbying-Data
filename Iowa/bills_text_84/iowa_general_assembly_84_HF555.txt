EXPLANATION
32


GENERALLY.
The
bill
relates
to
ethanol
blended
gasoline
33


regulated
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship
34


pursuant
to
Code
chapter
214A
and
classified
according
to
the
35

LSB

H.F.
555


percentage
of
ethanol
blended
into
the
gasoline
(e.g.,
E-10
1


means
a
gallon
of
gasoline
containing
10
percent
ethanol).
2


ETHANOL
PROMOTION
TAX
CREDIT.
The
bill
amends
the
ethanol
3


promotion
tax
credit
which
is
calculated
separately
for
each
4


retail
motor
fuel
site
from
which
the
retail
dealer
sells
and
5


dispenses
ethanol
blended
gasoline
(Code
sections
422.11N
and
6


422.33,
subsection
11A).
The
tax
credit
rate
depends
upon
the
7


number
of
gallons
of
ethanol
blended
gasoline
and
biodiesel
8


blended
fuel
that
a
retail
dealer
sold
throughout
a
calendar
9


year
(referred
to
as
a
determination
period).
The
amount
of
10


the
tax
credit
depends
upon
whether
the
retail
dealer
met
that
11


biofuel
threshold.
This
bill
renames
the
tax
credit
as
the
12


E-15
promotion
tax
credit,
and
provides
that
the
tax
credit
13


applies
only
to
those
gallons
of
ethanol
blended
gasoline
14


designated
as
E-15
or
higher.
It
also
allows
a
retail
dealer
15


filing
a
tax
return
on
a
noncalendar
year
basis
to
claim
the
16


tax
credit.
The
tax
credit
is
eliminated
on
January
1,
2021.
17


REPORTING.
The
bill
also
amends
reporting
requirements
18


by
retail
dealers
and
the
department
of
revenue.
A
retail
19


dealer’s
report
calculates
the
total
motor
fuel
gallonage,
20


and
further
divides
that
number
based
on
a
number
of
21


classifications
depending
upon
the
type
of
motor
fuel
sold,
22


including
ethanol
blended
gasoline
gallonage.
The
department
23


then
calculates
the
aggregate
total
for
the
motor
fuel
24


gallonage
including
by
classification
for
the
determination
25


period.
The
bill
revises
the
reporting
classifications
for
26


ethanol
blended
gasoline,
by
including
subclassifications
for
27


E-9
and
E-10,
E-11
to
E-15,
and
E-16
to
E-85.
It
provides
that
28


the
department
may
establish
additional
subclassifications.
29


The
bill
is
effective
on
January
1,
2012,
and
tax
credit
30


provisions
are
applicable
to
the
tax
years
beginning
on
or
31


after
that
date.
