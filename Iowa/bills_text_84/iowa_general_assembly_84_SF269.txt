EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
provides
that
an
on-farm
processing
operation
3


may
be
exempt
from
state
regulations
governing
wastewater
4


discharge,
if
the
waste
produced
by
the
processing
operation
5


meets
certain
standards
measuring
“biochemical
oxygen
demand”,
6


a
chemical
procedure
which
determines
the
amount
of
dissolved
7


oxygen
in
a
volume
of
water
required
to
break
down
the
organic
8


compounds.
The
exemption
provided
in
the
bill
would
apply
to
9


an
operation
that
processes
a
food
commodity
produced
on
that
10


farm
or
another
farm
and
includes
a
dairy,
creamery,
winery,
11


distillery,
or
cannery.
The
standards
apply
to
both
disposal
12


by
land
application
and
on-site
wastewater
treatment
systems
13


including
a
private
septic
system.
The
bill
requires
the
14


department
to
adopt
guidelines
by
rule
that
could
be
used
by
15


creameries
and
wineries
to
determine
if
they
qualify
for
the
16


exemption.
If
a
person
is
a
small
animal
feeding
operation,
17


the
person
may
dispose
of
the
wastewater
in
the
same
manner
as
18


manure.
19


The
bill
also
authorizes
the
department
of
natural
resources
20


to
adopt
rules
providing
further
exemptions
applicable
to
21


on-farm
processing
operations.
