WHEREAS,
the

afforded
by
the
First
Amendment
4


of
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
to
the
people
of
our
5


nation
are
fundamental
to
our
democracy;
and
6


WHEREAS,
the
First
Amendment
of
the
Constitution
of
the
7


United
States
was
designed
to
protect
the
free
speech
rights
of
8


people
regardless
of
wealth,
and
not
corporations;
and
9


WHEREAS,
corporations
are
not
people
who
are
entitled
to
10


constitutional
rights
of
citizenship
but
instead
are
entities
11


created
by
the
laws
of
states
and
nations;
and
12


WHEREAS,
for
the
past
three
decades,
a
divided
United
States
13


Supreme
Court
has
transformed
the
First
Amendment
into
a
14


powerful
tool
for
corporations
seeking
to
evade
and
invalidate
15


democratically
enacted
reforms;
and
16


WHEREAS,
this
corporate
misuse
of
the
First
Amendment
and
17


the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
has
reached
an
extreme
18


conclusion
in
the
United
States
Supreme
Court’s
ruling
in
19


Citizens
United
v.
Federal
Election
Commission,
130
S.
Ct.
876
20


(2010);
and
21


WHEREAS,
the
Supreme
Court’s
ruling
in
Citizens
United
v.
22


Federal
Election
Commission
overturned
long-standing
precedent
23


prohibiting
corporations
from
spending
their
general
treasury
24


funds
in
our
elections;
and
25


WHEREAS,
the
opinion
of
the
four
dissenting
justices
in
26


Citizens
United
v.
Federal
Election
Commission
noted
that
27


corporations
have
special
advantages
not
enjoyed
by
natural
28


persons,
such
as
limited
liability,
perpetual
life,
and
29


favorable
treatment
of
the
accumulation
and
distribution
of
30


assets,
that
allow
them
to
spend
prodigious
sums
on
campaign

messages
that
have
little
or
no
correlation
with
the
beliefs
32


held
by
natural
persons;
and
33


WHEREAS,
the
majority
opinion
of
the
Supreme
Court
in
Austin
34


v.
Michigan
Chamber
of
Commerce,
494
U.S.
652
(1990),
ruled
35


that
the
people
have
a
compelling
interest
in
preventing
the
36


corrosive
and
distorting
effects
of
immense
aggregations
of
37


wealth
that
are
accumulated
with
the
help
of
the
corporate
form
38


and
that
have
little
or
no
correlation
to
the
public’s
support
39


for
the
corporation’s
political
ideas
from
unduly
influencing
40


our
political
process;
and
41


WHEREAS,
the
Supreme
Court’s
ruling
in
Citizens
United
42


v.
Federal
Election
Commission
will
now
unleash
a
torrent
of
43


corporate
money
into
our
political
process
unmatched
by
any
44


campaign
expenditure
totals
in
United
States
history;
and
45


WHEREAS,
Citizens
United
v.
Federal
Election
Commission
46


purports
to
invalidate
state
laws
and
even
state
constitutional
47


provisions
separating
corporate
money
from
elections;
and
48


WHEREAS,
the
Supreme
Court’s
ruling
in
Citizens
United
v.
49


Federal
Election
Commission
represents
a
serious
and
direct
50


threat
to
our
democracy;
and
51


WHEREAS,
the
general
public
and
political
leaders
in
the
52


United
States
have
recognized,
since
the
founding
of
our
53


country,
that
the
interests
of
corporations
do
not
always
54


correspond
with
the
public
interest
and
that,
therefore,
the
55


political
influence
of
corporations
should
be
limited;
and
56


WHEREAS,
in
1816,
Thomas
Jefferson
wrote,
“I
hope
...
57


we
shall
crush
in
its
birth
the
aristocracy
of
our
moneyed
58


corporations,
which
dare
already
to
challenge
our
government
59


to
a
trial
of
strength
and
bid
defiance
to
the
laws
of
our
60


country”;
and
61


WHEREAS,
Article
V
of
the
Constitution
of
the
United
States
62


empowers
and
obligates
the
people
and
states
of
the
United
63


States
of
America
to
use
the
constitutional
amendment
process
64


to
correct
those
egregiously
wrong
decisions
of
the
United
65


States
Supreme
Court
that
go
to
the
heart
of
our
democracy
and
66


republican
self-government;
