BY
WATTS


A
Resolution
calling
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
state
1


of
Iowa
from
the
Midwestern
Regional
Greenhouse
Gas
2


Reduction
Accord.
3


WHEREAS,
there
has
been
no
credible
economic
4


analysis
of
the
costs
associated
with
carbon-reduction
5


mandates
and
the
consequential
effect
of
the
increasing
6


costs
of
conducting
business
in
this
state;
and
7


WHEREAS,
forcing
business,
industry,
and
food
8


producers
to
reduce
carbon
emissions
through
government
9


mandates
and
cap-and-trade
policies
under
consideration
10


for
the
regional
climate
initiative
will
increase
the
11


cost
of
conducting
business,
push
companies
to
conduct
12


business
with
other
states
or
nations,
and
increase
13


consumer
costs
for
electricity,
fuel,
and
food;
and
14


WHEREAS,
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
warns
that
15


the
cost
of
cap-and-trade
policies
will
be
borne
by
16


consumers
and
will
place
a
disproportionately
high
17


burden
on
poorer
families;
and
18


WHEREAS,
simply
reducing
carbon
emissions
in
19


this
state
will
not
have
a
significant
impact
on
20


international
carbon
reduction,
especially
while
21


countries
like
China,
Russia,
Mexico,
and
India
22


emit
an
ever-increasing
amount
of
carbon
into
the
23


atmosphere;
and
24


WHEREAS,
a
tremendous
amount
of
economic
growth
25


would
be
sacrificed
for
a
reduction
in
carbon
emission
26


that
would
have
no
appreciable
impact
on
global
27


concentrations
of
carbon
dioxide;

WHEREAS,
no
state
or
nation
has
enhanced
economic
1


opportunities
for
its
citizens
or
increased
gross
2


domestic
product
through
cap-and-trade
or
other
carbon
3


reduction
policies;
and
4


WHEREAS,
Europe’s
cap-and-trade
system
has
been
5


undermined
by
political
favoritism,
and
accounting
6


irregularities
and
has
failed
to
achieve
carbon
7


reduction
targets;
NOW
THEREFORE,
8


BE
IT
RESOLVED
BY
THE
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES,
That
9


the
House
of
Representatives
urges
the

10

Midwestern
Regional
11


Greenhouse
Gas
Reduction
Accord;
and

BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
