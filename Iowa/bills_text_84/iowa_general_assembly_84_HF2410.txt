EXPLANATION
17


This
bill
relates
to
matters
concerning
the
regulation
18


of
snowmobiles,
all-terrain
vehicles,
and

by
19


the
department
of
natural
resources,
and

SNOWMOBILE
REGULATION.
The
bill
makes
numerous
revisions
22


to
Code
chapter
321G,
which
provides
for
the
regulation
of
23


snowmobiles
by
the
department.
24


The
bill
defines
”resident“
and
”nonresident“,
for
purposes
25


of
snowmobile
regulation,
to
mean
the
same
as
defined
for
26


purposes
of
hunting
and
fishing
licenses.
27


The
bill
defines
”public
water“
as
any
navigable
waters
28


within
the
state
and
the
marginal
river
areas
adjacent
to
the
29


state,
other
than
farm
ponds,
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
30


natural
resource
commission.
A
similar
definition
is
provided
31


for
”public
ice“,
and
various
sections
of
Code
chapter
321G
are
32


amended
to
specify
the
defined
term.
33


The
bill
specifies
that
the
natural
resource
commission
may
34


adopt
rules
for
the
use
of

on
designated

trails
and
for
maintenance,
signing,
and
operation
of
the
1


trails,
and
existing
provisions
are
amended
to
indicate
that
2


operation
on
designated
trails
is
subject
to
regulation
by
3


the
department.
The
scope
of
grant
programs
and
contracts
4


administered
by
the
department
is
expanded
to
include
5


the
signage
of
designated

is
defined
to
mean
a

any
public
land,
private
land,
or
public
ice
that
is
8


designated
by
the
department,
a
political
subdivision,
or
a
9


controlling
authority
for
snowmobile
use.
10


Currently,
all

except
for
certain
snowmobiles
12


owned
and
used
by

or

used
13


in

A
nonresident
must
obtain
an
annual
user
permit
14


to

15


The

extends
the
user

well
as
nonresidents.
Under
the
bill,
a
resident
17


of

a
registered
18


snowmobile
on
public
land,
public
ice,
or
designated
snowmobile
19


trails.
A
nonresident’s
snowmobile
must
be
registered
in
20


accordance
with
the
requirements
of
another
state
and
the
21


operator
must
obtain
a
user
permit
for
operation
on
public
22


land,
public
ice,
or
designated
snowmobile
trails
in
Iowa.
23


The
registration
decal
of
this
state
or
another
state
and
the
24


user
permit
decal
issued
by
this
state
must
be
displayed
on
a
25


snowmobile
operated
on
public
land,
public
ice,
or
designated
26


snowmobile
trails
in
Iowa.
Pursuant
to
current
law,
the
fee
27


for
a
user
permit
is
$15
plus
an
administrative
fee
of
$1.50
28


and
a
writing
fee
of
$1
if
the
permit
is
issued
by
a
license
29


agent
or
$1.25
if
the
permit
is
issued
by
a
county
treasurer.
30


The
bill
specifies
that
the
original
application
for
31


registration
of
a
snowmobile
must
be
filed
with
the
county
32


recorder

the
owner’s
county
of

or

a

If
a

occurs
by

registrations
and

may
be
accomplished
2


through
a
county

or
a

3


The
bill
provides
that
a
snowmobile
owned
by
the
United
4


States,
this
state,
or
another
state,
or
by
a
governmental
5


subdivision,
is
exempt
from
registration
and
user
permit
6


requirements
in
this
state
if
the
snowmobile
is
used
for
7


enforcement,
search
and
rescue,
or
official
research
and
8


studies,
but
not
for
recreational
or
commercial
purposes.
9


Current
provisions
for
the
issuance
of
registration
10


certificates
and
registration
decals
for
snowmobiles
owned
by
11


the
state
of
Iowa
or
its
political
subdivisions
are
stricken.
12


The
bill
makes
a
technical
change
requiring
that
every
13


snowmobile
be
equipped
with
a
headlight
and
a
taillight,
rather
14


than
a
headlamp
and
a
tail
lamp.
15


The
bill
prohibits
a
person
from
water
skipping
a
snowmobile
16


on
public
water,
except
on
rivers
and
streams
during
the
period
17


between
November
1
and
April
1.
A
violation
is
a
simple
18


misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$100.
”Water
19


skipping“
is
defined
as
the
operation
of
a
snowmobile
on
the
20


surface
of
water
using
the
skis,
track,
and
bottom
surface
of
21


the
snowmobile
for
flotation
while
the
snowmobile
is
in
motion.
22


The
bill
makes
technical
changes
to
clarify
language
23


relating
to
stop
signal
violations.
24


The
bill
increases
the
fee
for
a
special
registration
25


certificate
from
$15
to
$45
for
snowmobile
manufacturers,
26


distributors,

and
extends
the
registration
period
27


from
one
year
to

The
bill

Pursuant

the
direct
supervision
of
a
5


parent,
guardian,
or
another
adult
authorized
by
the

The
bill
makes
a
terminology
change
by
replacing
the
7


existing
”safety
certificate“
with
an
”education
certificate“
8


throughout
Code
chapter
321G.
In
addition,
the
bill
defines

supervision“
to
mean
providing

of
another
10


person

Currently,

must
have
12


a
safety
certificate
to
operate
a
snowmobile
on
or

public

The
bill
extends
the

to
persons
14


under

15


The
bill
authorizes
the

to
develop
requirements
16

of
online
education
resulting
17


in
the
issuance
of
education
certificates.
A
vendor
must
18


enter
into
a
memorandum
of
understanding
with
the
department
19


to
conduct
such
a
course.
Pursuant
to
the
memorandum
of
20


understanding,
a
vendor
may
charge
a
fee
for
the
online
course
21


and
collect
the
education
certificate
fee
on
behalf
of
the
22


department.
23


The
bill
provides
that
when
a
serial
number
on
a
snowmobile
24


is
destroyed
or
obliterated
and
the
department
assigns
a
25


distinguishing
number
to
the
snowmobile,
the
department
may
26


issue
a
special
decal,
rather
than
a
plate,
to
be
affixed
to
27


the
snowmobile
and
bearing
the
distinguishing
number.
28


ALL-TERRAIN

The
bill
makes
numerous

revisions

which
provides
for

the
department.
31


The

In
addition,
the
bill
33


provides
that
off-road
utility
vehicles
are
subject
to
dealer

registration
and
