The
profession
is
regulated
by
a
licensing
board
under
the
1


aegis
of
the
department
of
public
health.
2


This
bill
adds
licenses
for
solar
thermal
professionals
and
3


contractors
to
Code
chapter
105.
A
solar
thermal
professional
4


is
a
person
who
designs,
installs,
alters,
repairs,
maintains,
5


relocates,
or
replaces
a
solar
heating
system
and
any
apparatus
6


or
equipment
used
in

the
system.
The
bill
adds
7


to
the
membership
of
the
licensing
board
one
person
who
is
a
8


solar
thermal
professional.
9


Unlike
plumbing,
HVAC,
refrigeration,
and

10


licensure
as
a
solar
thermal
professional
is
not
broken
into
11


apprentice,
journeyperson,
or
master
categories.
Licensure
as
12


a
solar
thermal
professional
requires
that
the
applicant:
13


1)
Pay
application
fees
as
established
by
the
board.
14


2)
Meet
the
minimum
educational
and
practical
experience
15


requirements
adopted
by
the
board
in
rule.
16


Licensure
as
a
solar
thermal
contractor
requires
that
the
17


applicant:
18


1)
Pay
application
fees
as
established
by
the
board.
19


2)
Provide
the
applicant’s
state
contractor
registration
20


number
and
meet
the
minimum
requirements
adopted
by
the
board.
21


3)
Maintain
a
permanent
place
of
business.
22


4)
Hold
a
solar
thermal
professional
license
or
employ
at
23


least
one
person
holding
a
solar
thermal
professional
license
24


under
Code
chapter
105.
25


Currently,
a
violation
of
Code
chapter
105
is
a
simple
26


misdemeanor.
A
simple
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
confinement
27


for
no
more
than
30
days
or
a
fine
of
