EXPLANATION

This
bill
relates
to
the
review
of
administrative
rules
and
6


the
rulemaking
process.
7


CITIZENS’
ADVISORY
COMMITTEE.
The
bill
requires
that
the
8


administrative
rules
coordinator
create
a
citizens’
committee,
9


to
advise
the
administrative
rules
coordinator
on
rulemaking
10


issues.
The
members
of
the
committee
shall
not
be

12


RULEMAKING
HEARINGS
THROUGHOUT
STATE.
The
bill
requires
13


administrative
agencies,
when
feasible,
to
hold
rulemaking
14


hearings
in
varied
locations
throughout
the
state
via
the
Iowa
15


communications
network
and
provides
that
a
hearing
must
be
held
16


in
a
particular
city
or
county
when
25
interested
persons
from
17


that
city
or
county
make
the
request.
18


PRINCIPAL
REASONS
FOR
AND
AGAINST
RULE.
The
bill
requires
19


that
every
adopted
rule
must
be
accompanied
by
a
concise
20


statement
of
the
principal
reasons
for
and
against
the
rule
21


adopted.
Under
current
law
such
a
statement
is
only
provided
22


on
request.
23


JOBS
IMPACT
STATEMENTS.
The
bill
requires
that
every
24


proposed
rule
under
a
notice
of
intended
action
contain
a
jobs
25


impact
statement
which
outlines
the
objective
and
statutory
26


authority
of
the
rule
and
analyzes
and
sets
out
in
detail
27


the
impact
of
the
proposed
rule
on
state
agencies,
local
28


governments,
the
public,
and
the
regulated
entities,
including
29


regulated
businesses
and
self-employed
individuals
affected
by
30


the
rule.
The
statement
must
also
determine
whether
a
proposed
31


rule
would
have
a
positive
or
negative
impact
on
private
sector
32


jobs
and
employment
opportunities.
33


Commencing
July
1,
2013,
and
every
five
years
thereafter,
34


each
agency
shall
prepare
a
jobs
impact
statement
for
all
of

the
agency
rules.
The
statement
will
be
published
in
the
Iowa
1


administrative
bulletin.
2


As
part
of
this
requirement,
an
agency
is
required
to
3


takes
steps
to
minimize
the
adverse
impact
on
jobs
and
the
4


development
of
new
employment
opportunities
before
proposing
5


a
rule.
6


The
administrative
rules
coordinator
may
waive
the
jobs
7


impact
statement
requirement
for
emergency-filed
rules
or
if
8


unnecessary
or
impractical.
9


NEGOTIATED
RULEMAKING
GROUPS.
If
required
by
statute,
10


this
bill
requires
an
agency
to
create
an
ad
hoc
negotiated
11


rulemaking
group
to
review
draft
rule
proposals
prior
to
12


commencing
a
rulemaking
proceeding.
Where
a
statute
does
13


not
require
this
review,
the
bill
allows
an
agency
to
create
14


such
a
review
group.
Members
are
appointed
by
the
agency
15


and
the
composition
must
adequately
represent
a
fair
balance
16


of
the
interests
affected
by
the
rule.
Once
such
a
group
is
17


created,
the
agency
may
only
commence
rulemaking
after
the
18


group
has
considered
the
draft
rule
proposal
in
question.
This
19


provision
is
based
on
similar
provisions
found
in
the
federal
20


Administrative
Procedures
Act.
21


USER-FRIENDLY
INTERNET
SITES.
The
bill
requires
each
22


agency
to
make
available
to
the
public
a
uniform,
searchable,
23


and
user-friendly
rules
database,
published
on
an
internet
24


site,
subject
to
the
direction
of
the
administrative
rules
25


coordinator.
Each
agency’s
internet
site
must
contain
26


specified
information
relating
to
the
agency’s
rules
and
27


available
procedures
for
public
participation.
28


FIVE-YEAR
CYCLE
OF
AGENCY
REVIEW
OF
RULES.
The
bill
requires
29


that
each
state
agency
review
all
of
its
administrative
30


rules
on
a
five-year
cycle.
The
plan
for
this
review
must
be
31


developed
in
consultation
with
stakeholders
and
constituent
32


groups.
The
goal
of
the
review
is
the
identification
and
33


elimination
of
all
rules
of
the
agency
that
are
outdated,
34


redundant,
overbroad,
ineffective,
unnecessary,
or
otherwise

4

regulation,
7


or
policy
by
a
state
agency

11


statute,
regulation,
or
policy
and
that

of
the

is
13


automatically

specific
requirements
of

14


federal
statute,
regulation,
or

ENVIRONMENTAL

The
bill
provides

of
17


natural
