exposure
could
result
in
the
transmission
of
the
virus,
or,
1


with
the
knowledge
the
infected
person
has
a
positive
human
2


immunodeficiency
virus
status,
does
not
consent
to
the
action
3


of
exposure.
The
bill
defines
“unprotected
intimate
contact”
4


to
mean
intimate
contact
that
does
not
involve
the
use
of
a
5


condom
or
similar
device.
Current
law
does
not
specify
whether
6


the
intimate
contact
be
protected
contact
or
unprotected
7


contact,
only
that
the
intimate
contact
lead
to
the
intentional
8


exposure
of
the
body
of
one
person
to
a
bodily
fluid
of
another
9


person
in
a
manner
that
could
result
in
the
transmission
of
the
10


human
immunodeficiency
virus.
11


The
bill
provides
a
different
criminal
penalty
for
criminal
12


transmission
of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
and
for
13


attempted
criminal
transmission
of
the
human
immunodeficiency
14


virus.
Under
the
bill,
the
criminal
penalty
for
criminal
15


transmission
of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
remains
a
16


class
“B”
felony
if
a
human
immunodeficiency
virus
infection
17


occurred.
If
no
human
immunodeficiency
virus
infection
occurs,
18


the
offense
is
classified
as
attempted
criminal
transmission
19


of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus,
and
this
offense
is
20


classified
as
an
aggravated
misdemeanor.
21


The
bill
strikes
a
provision
providing
an
affirmative
22


defense
to
the
crime
of
criminal
transmission
of
the
human
23


immunodeficiency
virus
when
the
alleged
victim
knew
of
the
24


defendant’s
positive
human
immunodeficiency
virus
status,
knew
25


the
action
of
exposure
could
result
in
the
transmission
of
26


the
virus,
and
consented
to
the
action
of
exposure
with
that
27


knowledge.
28


The
bill
strikes
the
requirement
that
a
person
convicted
29


of
criminal
transmission
of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
30


be
required
to
register
as
a
sex
offender
and
also
does
not
31


require
a
person
convicted
of
attempted
criminal
transmission
32


of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
to
register
as
a
sex
33


offender.
34


A
class
“B”
felony
is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
