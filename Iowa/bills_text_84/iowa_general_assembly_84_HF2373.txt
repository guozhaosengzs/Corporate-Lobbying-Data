and
to
aid
in

8


vehicle
laws
pertaining
to

The

shall
9


also
consider
the
feasibility
of
requiring

to
be
picked
up
and
dropped
off
on
the
side
of
the
road
on

13


issues
deemed

20


for

not,
by
implication
or
otherwise,
invalidate
any
prior
23


rulemaking
by
the
department
designating
certain

24


as

violations
and
does
not
preclude
future
rulemaking
25


by

EXPLANATION
16


This
bill
contains
provisions
relating
to
school
bus
safety.
17


Under
current
law,
when
the
driver
of
a
vehicle
meets
a
18


school
bus
with
flashing
amber
warning
lights,
the
driver
is
19


required
to
reduce
the
vehicle’s
speed
to
not
more
than
20
20


miles
per
hour
and,
when
the
stop
signal
arm
on
the
bus
is
21


extended,
bring
the
vehicle
to
a
complete
stop
and
remain
22


stopped
until
the
stop
arm
is
retracted.
The
driver
of
a
23


vehicle
overtaking
a
school
bus
may
not
pass
the
school
bus
24


when
the
bus’s
red
or
amber
warning
lights
are
flashing.
25


When
the
bus’s
stop
signal
arm
is
extended,
the
driver
of
26


an
overtaking
vehicle
must
stop
at
least
15
feet
from
the
27


school
bus
and
remain
stopped
until
the
stop
arm
is
retracted
28


and
the
bus
resumes
motion.
Currently,
a
violation
of
these
29


requirements
is
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
30


fine
of
$200.
Pursuant
to
Code
section
321.372A,
a
citation
31


for
such
a
violation
can
be
issued
to
the
owner
of
the
vehicle
32


if
the
identity
of
the
driver
cannot
be
determined
by
the
33


investigating
peace
officer.
34


The
bill
increases
the
penalty
for
a
first
offense
to
a
35

simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
fine
of
at
least
$250
but
1


not
more
than
$675
or
by
imprisonment
for
not
more
than
30
2


days,
or
by
both.
3


The
bill
provides
that
a
second
or
subsequent
violation
is
4


punishable
as
a
serious
misdemeanor.
A
serious
misdemeanor
is
5


punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
one
year
and
a
fine
6


of
at
least
$315
but
not
more
than
$1,875.
7


The
bill
adds
failure
to
obey
school
bus
warning
lights
and
8


stop
arm
signals
to
the
list
of
violations
for
which
additional
9


penalties
may
apply
in
cases
involving
serious
injury
or
death.
10


A
violation
causing
serious
injury
may
subject
the
driver
to
11


an
additional
fine
of
$500
or
driver’s
license
suspension
for
12


not
more
than
90
days,
or
both.
A
violation
causing
death
may
13


subject
the
driver
to
an
additional
fine
of
$1,000
or
driver’s
14


license
suspension
for
not
more
than
180
days,
or

In
15


addition,
the
bill
requires
the
department
of
transportation
16


to
initiate
rulemaking
by
July
1,
2012,
to
establish
failure
17


to
obey
school
bus
warning
lights
and
stop
arm
signals
as
a
18


serious
violation.
Driving
offenses
which
are
designated
as
19


serious
violations
are
grounds
for
suspension
of
a
person’s
20


driver’s
license.
The
bill
authorizes
the
department
to
21


provide
by
rule
for
an
increasing
tier
of
driver’s
license
22


suspensions
for
repeated
violations
of
school
bus
safety
laws.
23


The
bill
requires
the
departments
of
transportation,
24


public
safety,
and
education
to
jointly
conduct
a
study
25


relating
to
school
bus
safety
or
to
contract
with
an
outside
26


vendor
to
conduct
such
a
study.
The
study
shall
focus
on
the
27


effectiveness
of
cameras
mounted
on
school
buses
and
consider
28


the
feasibility
of
requiring
children
to
be

on
the
side
of
the
road

which

of

bus
safety
in

and
