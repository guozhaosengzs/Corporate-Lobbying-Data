provisions
applicable
to
fire
21


extinguishing

and
22


electricians
and
electrical
contractors.
23


With
reference
to
fire
extinguishing
and
alarm
systems
24


contractors
and
installers,
in
relation
to
the
definition
25


of
“responsible
managing
employee”
contained
in
Code
26


section
100C.1,
subsection
13,
the
bill
provides
that
for
a
27


telecommunications
company
that
has
been
issued
a
certificate
28


of
public
convenience
and
necessity,
a
responsible
managing
29


employee
may
be

only
one
fire

system
contractor
or

and
shall
not
be

3


more
than
two
fire
extinguishing
system
contractors
or
alarm
4


system
contractors,
respectively,
in
any
12-month
period.
The
5


subsection
currently
also
states
that
a
responsible
managing
6


employee
may
serve
in
such
capacity
for
a
fire
extinguishing
7


system
contractor
and
an
alarm
system
contractor
at
the
same
8


time,
provided
that
the
fire
extinguishing
system
contractor
9


and
the
alarm
system
contractor
are
the
same
business,
and
that
10


the
person
designated
as
the
responsible
managing
employee
11


meets
the
responsible

employee
criteria
established

for

The
bill
provides
that

13


shall
not
apply
to
a
responsible
managing
employee
with
whom
a
14


telecommunications
company
contracts
as
described
above.
15


With
reference
to
electricians
and
electrical
contractors,
16


the
bill
provides
that
whenever
the
term
“commercial”
is
17


used
in
Code
chapter
103,
it
refers
to
a
use,
installation,
18


structure,
or
premises
associated
with
a
place
of
business
19


where
goods,
wares,
services,
or
merchandise
is
stored
or
20


offered
for
sale
on
a
wholesale
or
retail
basis,
and
refers
to
21


a
residence
only
if
the
residence
is
also
used
as
a
place
of
22


business.
The
bill
states
that
“commercial”
does
not
refer
to
23


a
use,
installation,
structure,
or
premises
associated
with
24


either
a
farm
or
an
industrial
installation.
25


The
bill
removes
reference
to
farm
property
from
Code
26


section
103.22,
subsection
7,
which
provides
an
exemption
from
27


Code
chapter
103
for
performing
electrical
work
on
an
owner’s
28


principal
residence
under
specified
circumstances.
The
bill
29


creates
a
new
subsection
in
Code
section
103.22
specifically
30


relating
to
farm
property,
stating
that
the
Code
chapter’s
31


inapplicability
provisions
shall
cover
a
person
performing
any
32


installation
on
a
farm,
if
the
person
is
associated
with
the
33


farm
as
a
holder
of
a
legal
or
equitable
interest,
a
relative
34


or
employee
of
the
holder,
or
an

or

farm,
and
that
such
person
shall
not
be
required
to
be

under
the
Code
chapter.
The
bill
also
states
that
a
permit
is
2


not
required
for
an
installation
on
a
farm,
and
an
installation
3


on
a
farm
is
not
required
to
be
inspected.
In
order
for
a
farm
4


building
to
qualify
for
Code
chapter
inapplicability,
the
bill
5


provides
that
the
farm
property
shall
not
be
regularly
open
to
