EXPLANATION
1


This
bill
relates
to
illegal
immigration
in
Iowa.
2


The
bill
directs
the
attorney
general
pursuant
to
new
Code
3


section
13.11
to
negotiate
a
memorandum
of
understanding
(MOU)
4


regarding
immigration
issues
between
the
state
and
the
United
5


States
department
of
justice
or
the
United
States
department
6


of
homeland
security
in
order
to
increase
joint
enforcement
of
7


federal
immigration
law
with
the
United
States
department
of
8


homeland
security.
9


In
new
Code
section
91A.15,
the
bill
requires
an
employer
10


to
withhold
state
income
tax
from
the
compensation
of
an
11


independent
contractor
who
fails
to
provide
a
valid
social
12


security
number.
An
employer
who
fails
to
withhold
such
13


required
income
taxes
shall
be
liable
for
that
amount.
14


The
bill
creates
new
Code
chapter
91F,
which
requires
15


that
each
public
employer
use
the
federal
electronic
work
16


authorization
program,
known
as
e-verify,
to
verify
the
17


lawful
presence
of
newly
hired
employees.
Public
employers
18


are
prohibited
from
entering
into
contracts
unless
the
19


contractors
register
and
participate
in
the
e-verify
program.
20


The
discharge
of
a
United
States
citizen
or
a
permanent
21


resident
alien
employee
of
an
employer,
who,
on
the
date
of
the
22


discharge
employed
an
unauthorized
alien,
shall
constitute
an
23


unfair
trade
practice
and
the
discharged
employee
shall
have
a
24


private
right
of
action.
25

or
local
benefits,
or
federal
benefits
that
are
29


administered
by
the
state
agency
or
political
subdivision
30


using
the
systematic
alien
verification

The
Code
section

of
19


state
about

SAVE
program
by
