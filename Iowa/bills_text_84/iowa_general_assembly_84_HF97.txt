The

The

greater
than
one-half
of
1

the

an

for
which
such

was
found

at

two
additional
precincts.
If
the
second
audit
also
16


indicates
a
difference
in
the
vote
totals
that
is
greater

17


one-half
of
1
percent,

the

immediately
notify
the

20


commissioner
of

The
state
commissioner
may
direct
21


the

or
any
other
commissioner
of
a
county
where
22


the
office
appeared
on
the
ballot,
to
conduct
an
additional
23


audit
of
the
office
in
a
number
of
precincts
determined
by
the
24


state
commissioner.
25


The
bill
provides
that
if
a
recount
of
an
office
or
public
26


measure
is
requested,
the
postelection
audit
of
that
office
or
27


public
measure
shall
not
be
conducted
or
shall
be
terminated,
28


as
the
case
may
be.
29


The
bill
requires
the
state
commissioner
of
elections
to
30


make
public
the
results
of
postelection
audits.
31
