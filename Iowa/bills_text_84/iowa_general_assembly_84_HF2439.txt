property
qualifies
25


as
“property
purchased
for
resale

connection
with
the
26


performance
of
a
service”
if,
among
other
things,
it
is

28


of
a
fixed
or
definite
price
value
and
listed
as
a

charge.

that
property
which
is
entirely
30


consumed
in
connection
with
the

of
an

body
31


repair
service
will
also
qualify
as
“property
purchased
for
32


resale
in
connection
with
the
performance
of
a
service”,
and
33


provides
that
the
property
entirely
consumed
in
performance
of
34


the
service
need
not
be
listed
as
a
separate
charge.
