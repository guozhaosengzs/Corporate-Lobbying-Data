EXPLANATION
16


This
bill
provides
increased
penalties
for
certain
motor
17


vehicle
violations
committed
in
a
school
zone
and
makes
18


related
changes
to
conform
terminology
applicable
to
traffic
19


enforcement
near
schools
to
the
terminology
used
in
the
manual
20


on
uniform
traffic
control
devices
adopted
by
the
department
21


of
transportation.
22


Under
current
law,
“school
district”
is
defined,
for
23


purposes
of
motor
vehicle
laws,
as
the
territory
contiguous
24


to
and
including
a
highway
for
a
distance
of
two
hundred
feet
25


in
either
direction
from
a
schoolhouse
in
a
city.
The
bill
26


substitutes
the
term
“school
area”
for
“school
district”,
27


keeping
the
same
definition.
Code
section
321.249
currently
28


provides
for
the
use
of
portable
or
part-time
stop
signs
29


to
stop
vehicles
approaching
a
“school
zone”.
The
bill
30


substitutes
the
term
“school
crossing”
for
“school
zone”
in
31


that
provision.
Finally,
the
bill
newly
defines
“school
32


zone”
as
a
designated
roadway
segment
approaching,
adjacent
33


to,
and
beyond
school
buildings
or
grounds,
or
along
which
34


school-related
activities
occur,
which
is
established
as
a
35

H.F.
2084


school
zone
by
state
or
local
authorities.
1


Code
section
321.285
currently
states
that
a
2


25-mile-per-hour
speed
limit
applies
on
roadways
within
3


a
“school
district”,
as
currently
defined.
The
bill
amends
4


that
provision
to
impose
the
25-mile-per-hour
speed
limit
in
a
5


“school
zone”,
as
defined
under
the
bill.
6


Pursuant
to
current
law,
most
moving
traffic
violations
are
7


simple
misdemeanors,
punishable
by
scheduled
fines.
However,
8


increased
penalties
apply
for
violations
committed
in
a
road
9


work
zone.
The
bill
establishes
the
following
penalties
for
10


violations
committed
during
certain
hours
in
a
school
zone
11


that
mirror
the
penalties
currently
applicable
to
violations
12


committed
in
a
road
work
zone:
If
a
violation,
other
than
13


a
speeding
violation,
is
committed
in
a
posted
school
zone
14


between
the
hours
of
7:00
a.m.
and
5:00
p.m.
Monday
through
15


Friday,
the
regular
scheduled
fine
is
doubled.
If
the
16


violation
is
a
speeding
violation,
the
fine
is
$150
for
speed
17


not
more
than
10
miles
per
hour
over
the
speed
limit;
$300
for
18


speed
more
than
10
but
not
more
than
20
miles
per
hour
over
the
19


speed
limit;
$500
for
speed
more
than
20
but
not
more
than
25
20


miles
per
hour
over
the
speed
limit;
and
$1,000
for
speed
more
21


than
25
miles
per
hour
over
the
speed
limit.
22


In
accordance
with
the
manual
on
uniform
traffic
control
23


devices,
portions
of
roadway
designated
as
school
zones
are
24


marked
with
distinctive
school
zone
signs
and
with
supplemental
25


signs
relating
to
the
25-mile-per-hour
speed
limit
that
applies
26


in
school
zones.
The
manual
currently
requires
additional
27


signage
at
school
zones
if
higher
traffic
fines
apply.
28


However,
the
bill
provides
an
exception
to
that
provision,
29


stating
that
signage
referring
to
higher
traffic
fines
are
not
30


required
in
addition
to
posted
school
zone
signs.
