EXPLANATION
9


This
bill
relates
to
procedural
requirements
in
in
rem
10


forfeiture
proceedings.
11


Code
section
809A.13
provides
that
an
in
rem
forfeiture
12


action
may
be
brought
by
a
prosecuting
attorney
by
serving
a
13


notice
of
pending
forfeiture
on
the
owner
or
interested
party
14


or
by
filing
a
verified
complaint
of
forfeiture
in
court.
In
15


a
case
where
the
owner
or
interested
party
is
served
notice
16


of
the
pending
forfeiture,
Code
section
809A.11
provides
that
17


the
owner
or
interested
property
owner
can
file,
within
30
18


days
after
the
effective
notice
date,
a
claim
in
the
property.
19


No
similar
notice
or
claim
requirements
exist
if
the
in
rem
20


forfeiture
action
is
commenced
through
the
filing
of
a
verified
21


complaint.
The
bill
eliminates
the
procedural
limitation
that
22


only
allows
an
owner
or
an
interest
holder
in
property
that
is
23


the
subject
of
an
in
rem
forfeiture
action
who
has
been
served
24


notice
of
the
pending
forfeiture
and
who
has
filed
a
timely
25


claim
to
file
an
answer
in
the
action.
26


The
bill
is
in
response
to
an
Iowa
Supreme
Court
decision
27


filed
on
April
9,
2010
(In
re
Young,
780
N.W.2d
726),
in
which
28


the
court
held
this
statutory
provision
unconstitutional
29


because
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
precludes
an
aggrieved
30


property
owner
or
interested
party
from
filing
an
answer
to
the
31


stateâ€™s
in
rem
forfeiture
complaint
in
violation
of
state
and
32


federal
due
process
guarantees.
