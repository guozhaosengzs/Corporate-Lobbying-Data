The

EXPLANATION
17


This
bill
relates
to
health
care
cost
containment
measures.
18


The
bill
requires
the
commissioner
of
insurance
to
establish
19


a
health
insurance
and
cost
containment
bureau
within
20


the
insurance
division
which
is
responsible
for
creating
21


methodologies
to
hold
health
carriers
accountable
for
the
fair
22


treatment
of
health
care
providers
and
developing
affordability
23


standards
for
health
insurance
carriers
that
direct
carriers
24


to
promote
improved
accessibility,
quality,
and
affordability
25


of
health
care.
26


A
health
insurance
and
cost
containment
advisory
board
27


is
also
created
to
assist
the
commissioner
of
insurance
in
28


carrying
out
the
purposes
of
the
new
bureau.
The
advisory
29


board
is
comprised
of
seven

members
appointed
by
the
30


governor,
subject
to
confirmation
by
the
senate,

seven
31


nonvoting

shall
be
appointed
within

32


days
after
the
effective
date
of
the
bill.
The

and
a

The
nonvoting
members
are
the
commissioner
of
insurance,
the
2


director
of
human
services,
and
the
director
of
public
health,
3


or
their
designees,
and
four

of
the
general
assembly
4


appointed
by

senate.
6


Health
care
affordability
efforts
must
initially
focus
on
7


primary
care
to
create
a
stronger
primary
care
system
and
8


a
greater
supply
of
more
highly
compensated
primary
care
9


providers
by
targeting
more
funding
to
primary
care.
Beginning
10


on
December
31,
2013,
and
each
year
thereafter,
each
health
11


insurance
carrier
in
the
state
is
required
to
report
to
the
12


bureau
the
carrier’s
proportion
of
medical
expense
paid
for
13


primary
care
for
the
previous
12
months
and
the
proportion
14


of
medical
expense
to
be
allocated
to
primary
care
for
the
15


succeeding
12
months
beginning
on
January
1,
2014,
and
each
16


year
thereafter.
The
proportion
of
medical
expense
paid
for
17


primary
care
must
increase
by
at
least
one
percentage
point
18


per
year
for
five
years
beginning
on
January
1,
2014.
Health
19


insurance
carriers
are
also
required
to
submit
a
plan
that
20


demonstrates
how
the
increase
in
spending
for
primary
care
21


will
be
accomplished
without
contributing
to
an
increase
in
22


premiums.
23


Health
insurance
carriers
are
required
to
support
the
24


implementation
of
the
phase
of
the
medical
home

as
25


developed

of
public

26


that

The

advisory

of
the
medical

32

To

the
health
insurance
10


and
cost
containment
bureau
and
advisory
board
shall
develop
a
11


plan
to
implement
an
all-payer

database
by

for
the
collection
and
analysis
of

data
from

delivered
at
all
14

Care
Act.
The

recommend
a

19


reform
the

27


of
all

of
the

submit
