EXPLANATION
5


This
bill
relates
to
the
carrying
of
weapons
and
providing
6


a
penalty.
7


Current
law
provides
that
a
person
who
goes
armed
with
a
8


dangerous
weapon
concealed
on
or
about
the
person,
or
who,
9


within
the
limits
of
any
city,
goes
armed
with
a
pistol
or
10


revolver,
or
any
loaded
firearm
of
any
kind,
whether
concealed
11


or
not,
or
who
knowingly
carries
or
transports
in
a
vehicle
a
12


pistol
or
revolver,
commits
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
unless
13


certain
circumstances
apply
including
if
the
person
has
in
14


the
person’s
possession
a
valid
permit
to
carry
weapons.
The
15


bill
eliminates
this
provision
and
provides
that
a
person
who
16


goes
armed
with
a
dangerous
weapon
with
the
intent
to
commit
17


a
crime
of
violence
commits
a
class
“D”
felony
regardless
of
18


whether
the
dangerous
weapon
is
concealed
or
not
concealed
on
19


or
about
the
person
and
regardless
of
whether
the
dangerous
20


weapon
is
transported
in
a
vehicle.
For
purposes
of
the
21


bill,
“crime
of
violence”
means
a
felony
which
has,
as
an
22


element
of
the
offense,
the
use
of
physical
force
by
one
person
23


against
another
person.
A
class
“D”
felony
is
punishable
by
24


confinement
for
no
more
than
five
years
and
a
fine
of
at
least
25


$750
but
not
more
than
$7,500.
26


The
bill
eliminates
the
requirement
that
a
person,
including
27


a
person
employed
in
a
certain
occupation
whose
employment
28


reasonably
justifies
that
person
going
armed
with
a
dangerous
29


weapon,
must
have
and
carry
a
professional
or
nonprofessional
30


permit
to
carry
a
weapon
and
makes
it
optional
to
apply
for
and
31


receive
such
permits.
However,
if
a
person
applies
for
either
32


permit,
the
issuing
officer
(sheriff
or
commissioner
of
public
33


safety)
shall
issue
the
permit
if
certain
requirements
are
met.
34


Such
permits
shall
be
issued
for
a
five-year
period
at
a
cost

of
$50.
If
a
person
chooses
to
apply
for
a
professional
or
1


nonprofessional
permit
to
carry
weapons,
the
person
is
required
2


to
complete
a
firearm
training
program
conducted
by
a
private
3


individual
or
a
professional
organization
who
shall
conduct
4


the
training
consistent
with
the
standards
set
forth
by
the
5


national
rifle
association.
6


The
bill
makes
changes
to
current
requirements
relating
to
a
7


person’s
eligibility
to
apply
for
a
permit
to
carry
weapons,
8


firearms
training
requirements,
and
the
issuance
of
permits
9


to
carry
weapons.
The
bill
provides
that
an
applicant
for
a
10


professional
or
nonprofessional
permit
to
carry
weapons
who
is
11


otherwise
prohibited
by
state
or
federal
law
from
possessing
12


or
transporting
a
firearm
shall
not
be
eligible
for
the
13


permit.
The
bill
provides
that
the
issuing
officer
(county
14


sheriff
or
the
commissioner
of
public
safety)
conducting
15


a
firearm
training
program
is
required
to
contract
with
a
16


private
individual
or
a
professional
organization
to
conduct
17


the
training
consistent
with
the
standards
set
forth
by
the
18


national
rifle
association.
Any
person
eligible
to
be
issued
19


a
permit
to
carry
weapons
may
enroll
in
such
course.
A
fee
20


sufficient
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
program
may
be
charged
to
21


each
person
attending.
A
person
shall
not
be
issued
either
a
22


professional
or
nonprofessional
permit
unless
the
person
has
23


received
a
certificate
of
completion
or
is
a
certified
peace
24


officer.
An
applicant
shall
not
be
required
to
shoot
any
25


weapon
as
a
provision
of
passing
such
a
training
program.
The
26


bill
also
reduces
fees
collected
for
renewal
permits
as
well
27


as
certain
processing
fees.
The
bill
changes
the
period
of
28


time
that
an
issuing
officer
has
to
approve
or
deny
an
initial
29


or
renewal
application
from
within
30
days
of
receipt
of
the
30


application
to
within
three
business
days
of
receipt
of
the
31


application.
32


The
bill
also
repeals
Code
section
724.5
relating
to
a
33


person’s
duty
to
carry
a
weapons
permit
if
the
