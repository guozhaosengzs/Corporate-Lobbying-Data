EXPLANATION
12


This
bill
amends
requirements
relating
to
the
payment
of
13


certain
funds
between
school
districts
for
open-enrolling
14


pupils
pursuant
to
Code
section
282.18.
Currently,
the
board
15


of
directors
of
the
pupil’s
district
of
residence
(sending
16


district)
is
required
to
pay
to
the
district
to

the
17


student
is
open

(receiving
district)
the
state
18


cost
per
pupil
for
the
previous
school
year,
plus
any
moneys
19


received
for
the
pupil
as
a
result
of
the
non-English
speaking
20


weighting

section
280.4,
subsection
3,
for
the
21


previous

provision
and
makes
23


several

relating
to
the
payment
24


of

the
bill,
25


the
sending
district
is
not
required
to
pay
to
the
receiving
26


district
such
amounts
and
would
retain
the
state
cost
per
pupil
27


amount.
