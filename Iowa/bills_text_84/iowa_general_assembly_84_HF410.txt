Nothing

with
a
hit-and-run
motor
vehicle.
Coverage
for

underinsured,

vehicle
liability
must
18


equal
the
limits
of
liability
for
the
bodily
injury
portion
19


of
the
insurance
policy
instead
of
the
statutory
amounts
20


required
for
proof
of
financial
responsibility
in
Code
section
21


321A.1(11).
A
form
furnished
by
the

company
allowing

of
the
required
coverage
must
23


include
an
explanation
of
the
coverage
being
rejected
and
the
24


amount
of
premium
associated
with
the
coverage
being
rejected.
25


Code
section
516A.2(1)
is
amended
to
provide
that
such
26


coverage
may
include
provisions
that
are
designed
to
avoid
27


duplicate
payment
of
damages.
The
remainder
of
Code
sections
28


516A.2(1)
and

by,
another

under

Code
section

is
amended
to
provide
that
an
insurer
4


who
has
made
payments
under
a
policy
to
an
injured
party
is
5


entitled
to
proceeds
of
a
resulting
settlement
or
judgment
6


against
the
person
responsible
for
those
damages
only
to
the
7


extent
that
the
proceeds
combined
with
payment
made
by
the
8


insurer
exceed
the
injured
party’s
damages.
9


Code
section
516A.4(2)
provides
that
an
insurer
has
30
days
10


after
receipt
of
a
request
for
permission
to
settle
against
11


the
responsible
party,
to
either
consent
to
the
settlement
12


or
to
tender
substitute
payment
of
the
settlement
amount,
or
13


such
failure
will
constitute
consent
and
bar
the
insurer
from
14


claiming
prejudice
as
a
result
of
the
settlement.
15


Code
section
516A.4(3)
provides
that
when
an
insurer
pursues
16


a
claim,
through
subrogation
or
assignment,
against
the
party
17


responsible
for
bodily
injury
for
which
the
insurer
has
made
18


payments,
the
insurer
shall
include
the
damages
of
the
subrogor
19


or
assignor
and
tender
the
amount
to
the
assignor
or
subrogor
20


that
the
person
would
have
been
entitled
to
if
that
person
had
21


pursued
the
claim
directly.
22


Code
section
516A.4(4)
requires
an
insurer
to
act
in
good
23


faith
in
response
to
a
claim
for
uninsured,
underinsured,
or
24


hit-and-run
benefits
under
Code
chapter
516A
and
provides
25


that
an
insurer
that
does
not
act
in
good
faith
is
liable
26


to
the
person
owed
such
benefits
for
all
damages
caused
by
27


that
failure,
including
interest,
reasonable
attorney
fees
28


and
expenses,
and
punitive
damages
upon
the
showing
required
29


under
Code
chapter
668A.
For
the
purposes
of
this
provision,
30


"good
faith"
means
an
informed
judgment
based
on
honesty
and
31


diligence,
supported
by
evidence
that
the
insurer
knew
or
32


should
have
known
at
the
time
the
insurer
made
a
decision
on
33


the
claim.
The
insurer
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
it
acted
34


in
good
faith.
