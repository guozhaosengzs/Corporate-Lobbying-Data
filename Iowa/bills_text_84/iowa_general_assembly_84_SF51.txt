EXPLANATION
3


This
bill
enacts
new
Code
section
257.35A,
which
directs
4


state
aid
funding
for
special
education
support
services,
5


media
services,
educational
services,
area
education
agency
6


professional
development
supplement,
and
area
education
agency
7


teacher
salary
supplement
to
the
applicable
school
districts.
8


The
bill
allows
a
school
district
to
provide
its
own
9


services.
A
school
district
may
also
bid
to
provide
services
10


to
other
school
districts.
A
school
district
may
also
solicit
11


bids
from
organizations
to
receive
these
services.
If
a
school
12


district
provides
its
own
special
education
support
services,
13


media
services,
or
educational
services,
it
shall
not
receive
14


funding
that
exceeds
the
amount
determined
under
new
Code
15


section
257.35A.
The
bill
requires
area
education
agencies
16


(AEAs)
and
other
organizations
to
bid
to
provide
special
17


education
support
services,
media
services,
and
educational
18


services.
An
AEA
or
organization
that
successfully
bids
to
19


provide
these
services
to
a
school
district
will
receive
the
20


appropriate
amount
of
funding.
The
department
of
education
is
21


tasked
with
developing
the
bid
process
by
rule.
22


Currently,
area
education
agency
funding
operates
pursuant
23


to
a
“flow-through”
concept.
With
no
direct
taxing
authority,
24


AEAs
rely
on
local
school
districts
to
generate
funds
for
their
25


operation.
While
AEA
funding
is
included
within
a
school
26


district’s
budget,
the
district
does
not
actually
receive
27


AEA-related
state
aid
payments.
Instead,
funds
generated
by
28


the
districts
through
the
operation
of
the
school
finance
29


formula
and
earmarked
for
AEAs
are
subtracted
by
the
department
30


of
management
from
the
state
aid
otherwise
due
to
the
district
31


and
are
paid
directly
to
each
AEA.
32


The
bill
applies
to
school
budget
years
beginning
on
and
33


after
July
1,
2012.
