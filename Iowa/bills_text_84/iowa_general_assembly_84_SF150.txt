is
1


amended
to
read
as
follows:
2


14A.
“High
alcoholic
content
beer”
means
beer
which
contains
3


more
than
five
percent
of
alcohol
by
weight,
but
not
more
4


than
twelve
percent
of
alcohol
by
weight,
that
is
made
by
the
5


fermentation
of
an
infusion
in
potable
water
of
barley,
malt,
6


and
hops,
with
or
without
unmalted
grains
or
decorticated
and
7


degerminated
grains.
“High
alcoholic
content
beer”


does
not
8


include
beer
which
contains
added
caffeine
or
other
added
9


stimulants
including
but
not
limited
to
guarana,
ginseng,

EXPLANATION
14


This

excludes

containing
added
caffeine
or
other
added
16


stimulants
including
but
not
limited
to
guarana,
ginseng,
17


and

This
is
consistent
with
a
determination
by
the
18


federal

and
drug
administration
that
alcoholic
beverages
19


to
which

and
other

are
added
are
