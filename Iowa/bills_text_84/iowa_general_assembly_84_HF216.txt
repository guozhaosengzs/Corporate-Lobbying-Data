EXPLANATION
28


This
bill
creates
a
new
Code
chapter
91F
that
requires
an
29


employer

30


and

be
not
32


less

minutes
during
an
employee’s
work
period

more
than
seven
hours,
between
the
third
and
sixth
hours.
1


The
bill
states
that
an
appropriate
rest
period
shall
be
a
2


paid
period
of
not
less
than
10
minutes
during
every
four-hour
3


work
period.
The
rest
period
is
taken
in
the
middle
of
the
work
4


period.
The
rest
period
is
in
addition
to
the
meal
period
and
5


cannot
be
added
to
the
meal
period
or
deducted
from
the
work
6


period
to
reduce
the
overall
length
of
the
total
work
period.
7


The
bill
defines
an
“employee”
as
a
natural
person
who
is
8


employed
in
this
state
for
wages
by
an
employer.
An
“employer”
9


is
defined
as
a
person,
as
defined
in
Code
section
4.1,
who
10


employs
a
natural
person
for
wages.
11


The
bill
provides
that
an
employer
is
not
required
to
pay
for
12


a
meal
period
if
an
employee
is
free
from
work
duties
during
13


the
employee’s
entire
meal
period.
14


The
bill
allows
three
exemptions
to
the
meal
and
rest
period
15


requirements.
The
first
exemption
is
if
the
meal
and
rest
16


period
requirements
are
modified
by
the
terms
of
a
collective
17


bargaining
agreement.
However,
the
exemption
is
valid
only
18


if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
by
the
19


employees
prescribes
specific
terms
concerning
meal
periods
and
20


rest
periods.
21


The
second
exemption
states
that
meal
and
rest
period
22


requirements
apply
to
hourly
paid
and
salary-paid
employees.
23


However,
management
or
employees
involved
in
certain
24


agricultural
jobs
are
not
required
to
have
breaks
or
meal
25


breaks.
26


The
third
exemption
is
when
an
employer
can
show
that
the
27


ordinary
nature
and
circumstance
of
the
work
prevented
the
28


employer
from
establishing
and
maintaining
a
regular
scheduled
29


meal
period.
30


The
bill
provides
civil
penalties
for
violating
the
new
31


Code
chapter.
An
employer
who
violates
the
provisions
shall
32


be
subject
to
a
penalty
of
up
to
$100
for
each
violation.
The
33


labor
commissioner
may
recover
the
penalties
under
Code
chapter
34


17A
contested
case
procedures.
Any
penalties
recovered
shall

The
commissioner
may
propose
that
an
employer
be
assessed
a
2


penalty
by
serving
the
employer
with
notice
of
a
penalty
in
the
3


same
manner
as
an
original
notice
is
served
under
the
rules
of
4


civil
procedure.
5


The
bill
provides
the
labor
commissioner
with
the
authority
6


to
adopt
rules
to
administer
and
enforce
the
chapter
to
7


provide
further
exemptions
from
the
provisions
when
reasonable.
8


Also,
the
labor
commissioner
or
the
commissioner’s
designee
9


may
inspect
employment
records
relating
to
rest
periods
for
10


employees
and
interview
an
employer
or
employee
or
an
agent
11


of
the
employer
or
employee,
during
working
hours
or
at
