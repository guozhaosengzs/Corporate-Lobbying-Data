EXPLANATION
17


Currently,
an
excise
tax
is
imposed
on
each
gallon
of
motor
18


fuel
(generally
gasoline)
sold
in
the
state
(Code
section
19


452A.3).
The
general
tax
rate
is
20
cents
per
gallon,
but
20


subject
to
adjustment
each
12-month
period,
based
on
a
formula
21


which
produces
a
paired
rate
system
for
ethanol
blended
22


gasoline
and
other
motor
fuel.
The
paired
rate
system
is
23


eliminated
on
July
1,
2012.
After
that
date,
the
tax
rate
is
24


uniformly
imposed
at
20
cents
for
each
gallon
of
motor
fuel.
25


This
bill
extends
the
paired
rate
system
for
another
year
26


(until
July
1,
2013).
The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
