The
general
assembly
finds
that
a
regular
review
of
12


the
programs
and
projects
administered
by
state
government
is
13


necessary
to
determine
whether
each

is

effectively
and
efficiently
meeting
the
needs
for
which
created
15


and
whether
the
needs
remain
applicable.
The
general
assembly
16


further
finds
that
a
regular,
systematic
review
process
can
17


identify
the
programs
and
projects
that
are
no
longer
relevant
18


or
functioning
at
a
desirable
level
and
can
eliminate
or
19


reorganize
those

so
that

can
be
used
most
effectively
or
diverted

for

for
each

administered

by
a

of

over
