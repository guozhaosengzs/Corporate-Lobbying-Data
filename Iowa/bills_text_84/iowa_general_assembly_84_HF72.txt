1.
For
the
purposes
of
this
section,
unless
the
context
4


otherwise
requires:
5


a.
“Legitimate
poll”
means
a
telephone
communication
6


conducted
by
a
polling
firm
for
the
purpose
of
a
scientific
7


poll
of
respondents
in
order
to
gauge
public
opinion
concerning
8


a
candidate,
public
office
holder,
or
ballot
issue
that
is
part
9


of
a
series
of
like
telephone
communications
that
utilizes
a
10


scientific
sampling
technique
to
produce
a
random
sample
of
11


respondents.
12


b.
“Political
telemarketing”
means
the
canvassing
of
persons
13


under
the
guise
of
performing
a
legitimate
poll,
with
the
14


purpose
of
encouraging
support
of,
or
opposition
to,
a
clearly
15


identified
candidate
for
public
office
or
the
passage
or
defeat
16


of
a
clearly
identified
ballot
issue.
17


2.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
political
telephone
18


communication
is
increasingly
used
in
political
campaigns
in
19


this
state
in
a
deceptive
manner,
including
but
not
limited
20


to
the
use
of
political
telemarketing,
also
known
as
push-
21


polling,
where
an
anonymous
telephone
communication
is
22


designed
to
appear
as
a
legitimate
poll,
but
is
in
fact
used
23


to
communicate
certain
negative
information
related
to
a
24


candidate
or
ballot
issue.
The
general
assembly
declares
that
25


a
compelling
public
interest
exists
to
identify
the
source
of
26


funding
of
telephone
communications
related
to
elections
in
27


order
to
prevent
corruption
and
deceit
at
the
expense
of
the
28


electorate
and
to
preserve
accountability
for
expenditures
made
29


in
connection
with
political
campaigns.
30


3.
A
candidate,
an
authorized
representative
of
a
31


candidate,
a
candidate’s
committee,
or
a
political
committee
32


that
engages
either
in
a
telephone
communication
for
the
33


purpose
of
soliciting
contributions
or

telephone
34
