The
bill
authorizes
the
superintendent
of
a
school
district
4


or
the
administrator
of
an
accredited
nonpublic
school
to
waive
5


the
compulsory
attendance
requirement
for
a
student
who
has

reached
the
age
of
16
if
the
student,
the
student’s
parent
7


or
legal
guardian,
and
the
superintendent
or
administrator,
8


as
appropriate,
agree
in
writing
that
it
is
in
the
best
9


interest
of
the
student
that
the
student
not
be
required
to
10


attend
school.
If
the
compulsory
attendance

waived
for
a

the

including
12


provisions

20


district
from
state
school
foundation
aid
received
by
the
21


school
district
under
Code
section

is
deemed
to
constitute
state
compliance
with
any
state
mandate
23


funding-related
requirements
of
Code
section
25B.2.
The
24


inclusion
of
