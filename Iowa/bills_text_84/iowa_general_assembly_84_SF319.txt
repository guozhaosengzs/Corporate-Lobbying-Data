EXEMPTING
CATS
CLASSIFIED
AS
F-4
BENGALS
AND
SAVANNAHS.
The
4


bill
provides
an
exemption
for
a
cat
classified
as
a
bengal
5


which
is
a
cross
between
a
domestic
cat
and
an
Asian
leopard
6


cat
or
classified
as
a
savannah
which
is
a
cross
between
a
7


domestic
cat
and
a
serval.
In
both
cases
the
bill
requires
8


a
separation
of
four
filial
generations
between
the
Asian
9


leopard
cat
or
serval
and
the
exempted
cat.
The
generations
10


are
calculated
by
counting
from
the
first
filial
generation
11


which
is
the
offspring
of
the
original
crossing.
The
filial
12


generations
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
F-1
through
F-4
to
13


identify
the
first
four
filial
generations
of
offspring.
The
14


bill’s
exemption
applies
to
those
cats
classified
as
F-4
15


bengals
and
savannahs.
