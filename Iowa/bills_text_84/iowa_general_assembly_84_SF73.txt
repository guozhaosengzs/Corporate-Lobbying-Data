S.F.

Section
1.
Section
423.3,
Code
2011,
is
amended
by
adding
1


the
following
new
subsection:
2


NEW
SUBSECTION


.
96.
The
sales
price
of
a
physical
exercise
3


club
contract.
For
purposes
of
this
subsection,
“physical
4


exercise
club
contract”
means
the
same
as
defined
in
section
5


552.1,
and
“sales
price”
includes
“contract
price”
as
defined
6


in
section
552.1.

EXPLANATION
8


This
bill
creates
a
sales
tax
exemption
for
physical
9


exercise
club
contracts.
The
term
“physical
exercise
club
10


contract”
is
defined
in
Code
section
552.1
and
means
an
11


agreement
by
which
a
buyer
is
entitled
to
membership
in
a
12


physical
exercise
club
or
use
of
the
services
or
facilities
13


of
a
physical
exercise
club.
The
exemption
applies
to
the
14


“sales
price”
of
such
contracts,
which
is
defined
in
Code
15


section
423.1.
However,
because
Code
section
552.1
uses
16


the
term
“contract
price”
in
relation
to
physical
exercise
17


club
contracts,
the
definition
of
the
term
“sales
price”
is
18


supplemented
for
purposes
of
the
exemption
to
include
the
19


meaning
of
“contract
price.”
20


By
operation
of
Code
section
423.6,
an
item
exempt
from
the
21


imposition
of
the
sales
tax
is
also
exempt
from
the
use
tax
22


imposed
in
Code
section
423.5.
