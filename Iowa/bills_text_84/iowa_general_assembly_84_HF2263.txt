EXPLANATION
19


This

replaces
current
Code
provisions
relating
to
20


the
requirements
for
motor
vehicle
operators
approaching
and
21


stopping
at
railroad
grade
crossings
with
the
“Highway-Rail
22


Grade
Crossing

Act”,
which
is
proposed
in
model
23


legislation
developed
by
the
United
States
department
of
24


transportation,
federal
railroad
administration,
office
of
25


railroad
safety,
and
contained
in
the
publication,
“Model
26


State
Legislation
on
Highway-Rail
Grade
Crossing
Violations
by
27


Motorists,
September
2011”.
28


The
bill
states
that
the
purpose
of
the
new
provisions
is
to
29


prevent
collisions
and
casualties
to
motorists
and
passengers
30


at
public
highway-rail
grade
crossings
and
to
enhance
the
31


safety
of
transportation
by
railroad
and
highway.
32


The
bill
provides
definitions
for
key
terms,
including
33


“active
warning
device”,
“appropriately
equipped
flagger”,
34


“bodily

1


The
bill
prohibits
a
motorist
from
stopping
a
vehicle
on
2


a
highway-rail
grade
crossing.
The
bill
requires
a
motorist
3


to
stop
at
a
highway-rail
grade
crossing
that
has
a
stop
sign
4


and
provides
detailed
requirements
for
making
the
stop
and
5


for
determining
when
it
is
safe
to
proceed.
The
bill
directs
6


that,
when
approaching
a
crossing
marked
with
a
yield
or
7


crossbuck
sign,
a
motorist
shall
prepare
to
stop
and
yield
the
8


right-of-way
to
a
train
and
shall
stop
when
an
appropriately
9


equipped
flagger
or
a
law
enforcement
officer
signals
the
10


approach
of
a
train,
when
an
approaching
train
is
within
1,500
11


feet
of
the
crossing
and
is
sounding
an
audible
signal,
when
an
12


approaching
train
is
plainly
visible
and
in
hazardous
proximity
13


to
the
crossing,
when
there
is
not
enough
space
on
the
other
14


side
of
the
crossing
to
accommodate
the
motorist’s
vehicle,
15


or
when
it
is
otherwise
unsafe
to
proceed.
The
bill
provides
16


similar
directions
for
motorists
approaching
a
highway-rail
17


grade
crossing
with
an
active
warning
device
and
prohibits
18


a
motorist
from
driving
through,
around,
or
under
a
gate
or
19


barrier
at
a
crossing
while
the
gate
or
barrier
is
closed
or
is
20


being
opened
or
closed
except
as
directed
by
a
flagger
or
law
21


enforcement
officer.
22


The
bill
provides
general
guidelines
for
proceeding
safely
23


through
a
highway-rail
grade
crossing
by
controlling
the
24


speed
of
a
vehicle,
being
prepared
to
stop
when
approaching
a
25


crossing,
and
keeping
to
the
right
side
of
the
highway
when
26


approaching
a
crossing
except
in
one-way
traffic.
The
bill
27


prohibits
parking
at
a
distance
of
less
than
50
feet
from
a
28


crossing
except
when
necessary
to
avoid
conflict
with
other
29


traffic.
30


The
bill
establishes
the
following
penalties
for
31


highway-rail
grade
crossing
violations
by
motorists:
32


A
violation
of
requirements
at

is
34


a

and
$300
for
a
second
or
5


subsequent
violation
committed
within
an
18-month
period.
6


Any

by
a
motorist
of
highway-rail
grade
crossing
7


requirements
that
results
in
a
collision
causing
bodily
8


injury
to
another
person
is
a
serious
misdemeanor.
A
serious
9


misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
one
10


year
and
a
fine
of
at
least
$315
but
not
more
than

a

felony.

five
years
and
a
fine
of
at
least

but
not
more
than
$7,500.
15


The
bill
strikes
a
current
provision
in
Code
section
321.342
16


relating
to
stops
at
a
posted
railroad
grade
crossing,
which
is
17


now
addressed
in
Code
section
321.341
under
the
bill.
18


The
bill
repeals
Code
section
321.344B,
which
provides
19


a
penalty
for
railroad
crossing
violations
that
create
an
20


immediate
threat
to
the
safety
of
a
person
or
property.
The
21


section
is
no
longer
operative
because
the
penalty
provided
is
22


the
same
as
the
minimum
fine
under
current
law
for
any
railroad
23


crossing
violation.
