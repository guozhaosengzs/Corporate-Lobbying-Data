This
bill
addresses
supplier-dealership
agreements
under
1


Code
chapter
322F,
involving
franchises
for
agricultural
2


equipment;
all-terrain
vehicles;
and
construction,
industrial,
3


or
utility
equipment.
Generally
the
Code
chapter
regulates
4


business
relationships
between
dealerships
and
suppliers
5


by
providing
for
the
terms
and
conditions
of
dealership
6


agreements.
Code
section
322F.7
includes
a
list
of
supplier
7


violations
and
Code
section
322F.8
provides
a
list
of
causes
8


for
a
supplier’s
liability,
including
for
damages
sustained
9


by
a
dealer
as
a
consequence
of
a
supplier’s
violation
of
10


the
Code
chapter.
Code
section
322F.3
provides
that
if
a
11


supplier
terminates
a
dealership
agreement,
the
supplier
must
12


repurchase
the
dealer’s
equipment
and
parts
inventory.
The
13


bill
expressly
provides
that
if
a
supplier
is
found
liable
for
14


damages
resulting
from
a
violation
of
the
Code
chapter,
the
15


amount
due
the
supplier
bears
interest
at
the
same
rate
as
for
16


the
failure
to
repurchase
equipment.
It
also
provides
that
a
17


supplier’s
civil
liability
is
in
addition
to
the
repurchase
18


amount
required
to
be
paid
to
the
dealer.
