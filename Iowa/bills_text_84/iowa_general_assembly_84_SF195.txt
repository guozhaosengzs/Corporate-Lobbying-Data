21


provides
an
exemption
from

of

by
the

of

a

dealership
that,
upon
the
close
of
business,
23


transfers
the
dealership’s
remaining
vehicles
to
another
24


dealership
owned
by
the
same
person,
persons,
or
entity,
or
by
25


a
different
entity
that
shares
substantially
the
same
ownership
26


interest.
The
exemption
applies
only
when
the
closing
of
the
27


original
dealership
is
due
to
the
manufacturer’s
discontinuance
28


of
the
vehicle
brand
and
the
franchisee
is
responsible
29


for
disposition
of
vehicles
remaining
in
the
dealership’s
30


inventory.

The
bill
is

and
applies
32


retroactively
to
December
1,
2010,
for
vehicles
transferred
on
