UNIVERSAL
RECYCLING.
This
division
creates
mandatory
2


recycling
collection
requirements
called
universal
recycling.
3


Beginning
July
1,
2012,
the
division
requires
cities,
4


counties,
and
public
and
private
agencies
responsible
for
5


waste
management
to
provide
single
stream
recycling
collection
6


services
to
all
single-family
residential
customers
and
7


source-separated
recycling
collection
services
to
all
dealers
8


providing
on-premises
sales.
A
dealer
is
a
person
who
sells
9


beverages
in
beverage
containers.
Single
stream
recycling
10


is
a
system
in
which
recyclable
material
is
commingled
for
11


collection
into
one
container
instead
of
being
sorted
into
12


separate
commodities.
Source-separated
recycling
is
a
system
13


in
which
recyclable
material
is
segregated
at
the
point
14


of
generation
and
kept
apart
from
the
waste
stream
by
the
15


generator
of
the
recyclable
material.
16


Beginning
July
1,
2014,
the
division
requires
cities,
17


counties,
and
public
and
private
agencies
responsible
for
18


waste
management
to
provide
single
stream
recycling
collection
19


services
to
all
multifamily
residential
customers.
The
20


division
allows
a
waiver
from
the
requirements
if
the
waiver
21


applicant
can
demonstrate
physical
constraints
preventing
the
22


placement
of
solid
waste
and
recyclable
material
collection
23


containers
at
the
same
location.
The
division
requires
24


annual
recycling
instruction
to
be
provided
to
residents
at
a
25


multifamily
residential
complex.
26


By
July
1,
2012,
the
division
requires
the
department
of
27


natural
resources
to
submit
a
report
to
the
governor
and
the
28


general
assembly
regarding
the
implementation
of
mandatory
29


recycling
collection
requirements
for
the
commercial
sector.
30


The
recommendations
must
provide
a
method
for
engaging
31


the
active
participation
of
the
commercial
sector
in
a
32


comprehensive
recycling
program
by
not
later
than
July
1,
2014.
33


The
division
requires
cities
and
counties
to

Currently,
a
person
who
knowingly
makes
a
false
statement
or
2


representation
in
a
comprehensive
plan
is
guilty
of
a
serious
3


misdemeanor.
4


The
division
requires
the
department
to
establish
and
5


administer
a
universal
recycling
assistance
program
for
6


purposes
of
providing
financial
assistance
to
cities,
counties,
7


and
public
and
private
entities
for
the
initial
implementation
8


costs
associated
with
the
universal
recycling
requirements.
9


The
division
creates
a
universal
recycling
assistance
fund
and
10


appropriates
moneys
in
the
fund
to
the
department
for
providing
11


financial
assistance
under
the
program.
12


The
division
requires
a
recycling
fee
of
4
cents
to
be
13


paid
by
the
dealer
to
the
distributor
on
each
beverage
14


container
received
by
the
dealer.
On
a
monthly
basis
and
15


in
a
manner
determined
by
the
department,
the
division
16


requires
a
distributor
to
remit
all
fees
collected
by
the
17


distributor
to
the
department
for
deposit
in
the
universal
18


recycling
assistance
fund.
The
division
includes
a
reporting
19


requirement.
The
fee
is
repealed
June
30,
2015.
For
purposes
20


of
the
bill,
the
term
“beverage”
is
defined
to
include
wine,
21


alcoholic
liquor,
beer,
and
any
nonalcoholic
carbonated
and
22


noncarbonated
drink
excluding
grade

and
milk
products
23


specified
in
the
grade
“A”
milk
ordinance.
The
term
also
24


includes
certain
exemptions.
25


The
division
creates
a
recycling
public
advisory
board
for
26


purposes
of
advising
the
department
regarding
recycling
issues,
27


criteria
for
financial
assistance
under
the
universal

28


assistance
program,
criteria
for

from
the

fund,
a
methodology
for
measuring
waste
volume
reduction,
30


and
recycling
outreach
and

The

the

increases
the

placing

debris
on
public
highways
from
$70
to
$150
and
increases
the
2


scheduled
fine
for
littering
in
a
state

or

from

$30
to

Currently,
50

4


are
deposited
in
the
general
fund
and
appropriated
to
the
5


department
of

for
purposes
of

6


The

provides
that
100

of

are
to
be
deposited
in

with
50

for

providing

15


WASTE
REDUCTION
GOALS.
Currently,
waste
stream
reduction
16


goals
for
the
state
are
to
reduce
the
waste
stream
by
25
17


percent
by
July
1,
1994,
and
by
50
percent
by
July
1,
2000,
18


based
on
the
waste
stream
existing
as
of
July
1,
1988.
The
19


tonnage
fee
paid
by
a
planning
area
is,
in
part,
determined
by
20


the
waste
volume
reduction
goals
that
are
met
by
the
planning
21


area.
22


The
division
creates
new
waste
volume
reduction
goals.
The
23


goals
are
to
reduce
the
waste
stream
by
50
percent
by
July
1,
24


2016,
and
by
60
percent
by
July

2021,
based
on
the
waste
25


stream
existing
as
of
July
1,
2011.
The
division
replaces
the
26


old
goal
levels
with
the
new
goal
levels
in
the
computation
of
27


the
tonnage
fees
paid
by
planning
areas.
28


STATE
MANDATE.
The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
29


defined
in
Code
section
25B.3.
The
division
makes
inapplicable
30


Code
section
25B.2,
subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
31


political
subdivision
from
complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
32


funding
for
the
cost
of
the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
33


specified.
Therefore,
political
subdivisions
are
required
to
34


comply
with
any
state
mandate
included
in
the
bill.
