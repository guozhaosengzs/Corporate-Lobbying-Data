health.


However,

indicate
that
self-medication


for
diseases
other
than
those
named
in
this
subsection
is
safe


and
efficacious.

persons

by
highly
autonomous
community-based


service
providers
working
cooperatively

the
general
assembly
recognizes
that
heavy


reliance
on
property

has
enabled
many


counties
to
exceed

resulting
in
an
uneven

made
to
assure


ensure


close
coordination
and
continuity
of
care
for
those
persons


receiving
publicly
supported
disability

Section
915.38,
subsections
1
and
2,
Code
2011,



















Senate
File
2247,
p.
55


are
amended
to
read
as
follows:


1.
Upon
its
own
motion
or
upon
motion
of
any
party,
a
court


may
protect
a
minor,
as
defined
in
section
599.1
,
from
trauma


caused
by
testifying
in
the
physical
presence
of
the
defendant


where
it
would
impair
the
minor’s
ability
to
communicate,
by


ordering
that
the
testimony
of
the
minor
be
taken
in
a
room


other
than
the
courtroom
and
be
televised
by
closed-circuit


equipment
for
viewing
in
the
courtroom.
However,
such
an
order


shall
be
entered
only
upon
a
specific
finding
by
the
court
that


such
measures
are
necessary
to
protect
the
minor
from
trauma.


Only
the
judge,
prosecuting
attorney,
defendant’s
attorney,


persons
necessary
to
operate
the
equipment,
and
any
person


whose
presence,
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
would
contribute


to
the
welfare
and
well-being
of
the
minor
may
be
present
in


the
room
with
the
minor
during
the
minor’s
testimony.
The


judge
shall
inform
the
minor
that
the
defendant
will
not
be


present
in
the
room
in
which
the
minor
will
be
testifying


but
that
the
defendant
will
be
viewing
the
minor’s
testimony


through
closed-circuit
television.


During
the
minor’s
testimony
the
defendant
shall
remain
in


the
courtroom
and
shall
be
allowed
to
communicate
with
the


defendant’s
counsel
in
the
room
where
the
minor
is
testifying


by
an
appropriate
electronic
method.


In
addition,
upon
a
finding
of
necessity,
the
court
may


allow
the
testimony
of
a
victim
or
witness
with
a
mental


illness,
mental
retardation


an
intellectual
disability
,
or


other
developmental
disability
to
be
taken
as
provided
in
this


subsection
,
regardless
of
the
age
of
the
victim
or
witness.


2.
The
court
may,
upon
its
own
motion
or
upon
motion
of


a
party,
order
that
the
testimony
of
a
minor,
as
defined
in


section
599.1
,
be
taken
by
recorded
deposition
for
use
at


trial,
pursuant
to
rule
of
criminal
procedure
2.13(2)(b).


In
addition
to
requiring
that
such
testimony
be
recorded
by


stenographic
means,
the
court
may
on
motion
and
hearing,
and


upon
a
finding
that
the
minor
is
unavailable
as
provided


in
rule
of
evidence
5.804(a),
order
the
videotaping
of
the


minor’s
testimony
for
viewing
in
the
courtroom
by
the
court.


The
videotaping
shall
comply
with
the
provisions
of
rule


of
criminal
procedure
2.13(2)(b),
and
shall
be
admissible


as
evidence
in
the
trial.
In
addition,
upon
a
finding
of


necessity,
the
court
may
allow
the
testimony
of
a
victim


or
witness
with
a
mental
illness,
mental
retardation
an


intellectual
disability
,
or
other
developmental
disability
to

be
taken
as
provided
in
this
subsection
,
regardless
of
the
age


of
the
victim
or
witness.
