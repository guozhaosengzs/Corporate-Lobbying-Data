EXPLANATION
18


Under
current
law,
when
the
driver
of
a
motor
vehicle
is
19


approaching
a
stationary
authorized
emergency
vehicle
that
is
20


displaying
flashing
yellow,
amber,
white,
red,
or
red
and
blue
21


lights,
or
a
stationary
towing
or
recovery
vehicle,
utility
22


maintenance
vehicle,
municipal
maintenance
vehicle,
or
highway
23


maintenance
vehicle
that
is
displaying
flashing
yellow,
amber,
24


or
red
lights,
the
driver
is
required
to
move
into
a
lane
not
25


adjacent
to
the
stationary
vehicle
if
possible
in
the
existing
26


safety
and
traffic
conditions.
If
changing
lanes
would
be
27


impossible,
unlawful,
or
unsafe,
the
driver
is
required
to
28


reduce
the
speed
of
the
motor
vehicle
to
a
reasonable
and
29


proper
speed
for
the
existing
road
and
traffic
conditions,
30


which
speed
shall
be
less
than
the
posted
speed
limit,
and
be
31


prepared
to
stop.
This
bill
amends
the
provision
relating
32


to
reduced
speed
by
specifying
that
if
making
a
lane
change
33


would
be
impossible,
prohibited
by
law,
or
unsafe,
the
driver
34


shall
reduce
the
speed
of
the
motor
vehicle
to
a
speed
that
is
35


-3-


LSB
5683SV
(2)

dea/nh

S.F.
2257


at
least
10
miles
per
hour
below
the
posted
speed
limit
and
1


is
reasonable
and
proper
for
the
existing
road
and
traffic
2


conditions
and
the
driver
shall
be
prepared
to
stop.
3


Under
current
law,
a
violation
of
the
requirements
to
move
4


over
or
slow
down
when
approaching
certain
stationary
vehicles
5


is
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$100.
6


However,
if
the
violation
causes
a
serious
personal
injury,
7


a
court
could
impose
an
additional
fine
of
$500
or
suspend
8


the
person’s
driver’s
license
for
not
more
than
90
days,
or
9


both.
If
the
violation
causes
a
death,
a
court
could
impose
10


an
additional
fine
of
$1,000
or
suspend
the
person’s
driver’s
11


license
for
not
more
than
180
days,
or
both.
12


Under
the
bill,
a
violation
is
still
a
simple
misdemeanor
13


punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$100,
but
the
bill
14


establishes
an
additional
penalty
for
violations
causing
damage
15


to
property,
revises
the
existing
penalties
for
violations
16


resulting
in
bodily
injury
or
death,
and
makes
the
driver’s
17


license
sanctions
mandatory.
The
bill
provides
that
if
the
18


violation
results
in
an
accident
causing
damage
to
the
property
19


of
another
person
but
not
causing
bodily
injury
to
another
20


person,
the
department
of
transportation
shall
suspend
the
21


person’s
driver’s
license
or
operating
privileges
for
90
22


days.
If
the
violation
results
in
an
accident
causing
bodily
23


injury
to
another
person,
the
department
shall
suspend
the
24


person’s
driver’s
license
or
operating
privileges
for
180
25


days,
and
the
court
may
impose
a
fine
of
$500
in
addition
to
26


any
other
penalty
provided
by
law.
This
differs
from
current
27


law,
which
allows
a
$500
fine
for
violations
causing
bodily
28


injury
which
meets
the
standard
for
serious
bodily
injury.
The
29


bill
provides
that
if
the
violation
results
in
an
accident
30


causing
death,
the
department
shall
suspend
the
person’s
31


driver’s
license
or
operating
privileges
for
one
year
and,
as
32


is
currently
the
case,
the
court
may
impose
a
fine
of
$1,000
in
33


addition
to
any
other
penalty
provided
by
law.
34


The
bill
requires

department
of
transportation
