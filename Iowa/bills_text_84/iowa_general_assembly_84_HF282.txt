17


children,

spouse,
children,
and
20


parents
respectively.
Any
recovery
by

shall
be
subordinate

the
recovery,
if
any,
of
22


the
spouse
or
a
child
of
the
decedent.
If
the
decedent
leaves
23


a
spouse,
child,
or
parent,
damages
for
wrongful
death
shall
24


not
be
subject
to
debts
and
charges
of
the
decedent’s
estate,
25


except
for
amounts
to
be
paid
to
the
department
of
human
26


services
for
payments
made
for
medical
assistance
pursuant
to
27


chapter
249A
,
paid
on
behalf
of
the
decedent
from
the
time
of
28


the
injury
which
gives
rise
to
the
decedent’s
death
up
until
29


the
date
of
the
decedent’s
death.

2.


For
the
purposes
of
this
section,
“loss
of
enjoyment
31


of
life”


is
measured
separate
and
apart
from
the
economic
32


productive
value
the
decedent
would
have
had
if
the
decedent


33


lived
and
such
damages
shall
not
be
duplicative
of
damages


34
