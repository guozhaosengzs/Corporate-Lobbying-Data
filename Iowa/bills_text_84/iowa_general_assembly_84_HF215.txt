EXPLANATION
9


This
bill
amends
Code
section
85.34
to
expand
the
10


circumstances
under
which
an
employer
can
receive
credit
for
11


overpayment
of
certain
weekly
workers’
compensation
benefits.
12


Currently,
if
an
employee
is
overpaid
weekly
workers’
13


compensation
benefits,
the
excess
paid
by
the
employer
is
14


credited
against
the
liability
of
the
employer
for
any
future
15


weekly
permanent
partial
disability
benefits
due
from
that
16


employer
for
a
subsequent
injury
to
the
same
employee.
17


The
bill
provides
that
if
an
employee
is
paid
any
excess
18


weekly
benefits,
the
employer
is
entitled
to
a
credit
against
19


the
liability
of
the
employer
for
any
weekly
benefits,
20


interest,
or
penalty
benefits
owed
or
awarded
to
the
employee
21


for
the
same
injury.
Any
remaining
excess
payments
are
then
22


credited
against
the
liability
of
the
same
employer
for
any
23


weekly
benefits,
interest,
or
penalty
benefits
owed
or
awarded
24


for
a
subsequent
injury
to
the
same
employee
as
long
as
the
25


overpayment
is
recognized
in
a
settlement
agreement
approved
26


by
the
commissioner,
or
is
recognized
pursuant
to
final
agency
27


action
in
a
contested
case,
as
specified
in
the
bill.
