EXPLANATION
13


This

codifies
the
department
of
education’s
rules
that
14


specify
the
appropriate
uses
of
the
returning
dropout
and
15


dropout
prevention
program
funding
for
school
districts
as
16


authorized
by
the
department
of
education,
but
modifies
the
17


list
of
appropriate
uses
by
adding
that
administrative
costs
18


related
to
the
returning
dropout
and
dropout
prevention
program
19


are
an
appropriate
use
of
the
funding.
Under
the
department’s
20


rules,
administrative
costs
other
than
those
related
to
a
21


separate
school
located
off
site,
and
where
the
administrator
22


is
assigned
exclusively
to
this
program,
are
an
inappropriate
23


use
of
the
funding.

uses
of
funding
as
specified
by
both
the
25


department’s
administrative
rules
and

bill

26


and
benefits
for
teachers
and
guidance
counselors
when
those

persons
are

to
working
with
returning
dropouts
or
28


students
who
are
deemed,
at
anytime
during
the
school
year,
29


to
be
at
risk
of
dropping
out,
to
provide
services
beyond
30


those
provided
by
the
school
district
to
students
generally;
31


professional
development
for
all
teachers
and
staff
working
32


with
at-risk
students
and
programs
involving
dropout
prevention
33


strategies;
and
research-based
resources,
materials,
software,
