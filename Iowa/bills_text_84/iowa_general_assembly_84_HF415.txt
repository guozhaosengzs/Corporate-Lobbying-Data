A
recent
Iowa
court
of
appeals
decision
indicates
that
a
1


court’s
decision
on
removal
of
a
child’s
guardian
in
such
cases
2


must
be
based
upon
proof
of
unreasonable
actions
on
the
part
of
3


the
guardian.
The
bill
provides
that
if
the
child’s
guardian
4


is
the
department
or
an
agency,
and
the
court
finds
by
clear
5


and
convincing
evidence
that
removal
of
the
guardian
is
in
the
6


child’s
best
interest,
the
court
must
order
removal
of
the
7


guardian
and
appoint
a
replacement
guardian
under
Code
section
8


232.117,
subsection
3.
However,
the
court
is
prohibited
from
9


ordering
the
removal
over
a
formal
objection
to
the
removal
10


filed
by
the
child’s
attorney
or
guardian
ad
litem
unless
the
11


court
finds
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
removal
of
12


the
guardian
is
in
the
child’s
best
interest.
The
bill
lists
13


various
factors
concerning
the
child
and
the
petitioner
that
14


may
be
considered
by
the
court.
