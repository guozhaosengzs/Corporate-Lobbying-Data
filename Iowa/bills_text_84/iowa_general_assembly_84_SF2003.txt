This

allows

by
a
licensed
hospital
to
use
flashing
white
lights
on
29


a
personal
motor
vehicle
when

The
30


bill

a
person
who
is
31


licensed,
certified,
or
otherwise

S.F.
2003


the
use
of
flashing
white
lights
on
a
vehicle
owned
by
a
health
1


care
professional
in
a
manner
similar
to
the
process
currently
2


in
place
for
members
of
an
ambulance,
rescue,
or
first
response
3


service.
The
health
care
professional’s
application
to
the
4


department
of
public
health
must
demonstrate
a
necessity
5


for
authorization.
The
hospital
that
employs
the
health
6


care
professional
must
recommend
that
the
authorization
be
7


granted
and
must
certify
that
the
health
care
professional
is
8


an
employee
in
good
standing
and,
in
the
regular
course
of
9


employment,
is
required
to
be
on-call
for
medical
emergencies.
10


The
bill
authorizes
the
department
to
adopt
rules
11


establishing
standards
for
the
issuance
of
certificates
of
12


authorization
by
hospitals
and
establishing
procedures
for
13


revocation
of
certificates
of
authorization.
14


The
authorized
use
of
flashing
white
lights
on
a
motor
15


vehicle
identifies
the
vehicle
as
being
operated
in
the
course
16


of
an
emergency,
but
does
not
authorize
the
driver
to
operate
17


the
vehicle
in
violation
of
traffic
laws.
Pursuant
to
current
18


law,
the
unauthorized
use
of
flashing
white
lights
on
a
motor
19


vehicle
is
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
20


of
$30.
