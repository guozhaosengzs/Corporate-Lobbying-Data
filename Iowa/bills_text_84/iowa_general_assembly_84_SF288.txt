board
12


may
consider

or
resulting
in
the
16


violation.

of
harm
to
the
18


public.

The
economic
benefits
gained
by
the
violator
as
a
result
20


of
noncompliance.

e.
The
welfare
or
best
interest
of
the
public.

The
board
may
conduct
an
investigation
as
needed
to
23


determine
whether
probable
cause
exists
to
initiate
the
24


proceedings
described
in
this
subsection.
