EXPLANATION
7


This

provides
that
a

sus
scrofa

including
but

boar
or
European
10


boar
of
either
sex
(referred
to
in
the
bill
as
a
boar).
11


Currently,
a
person
is
prohibited
from
owning
a
boar
because
12


its
species
is
classified
as
a
wild
or
dangerous
animal
13


under
Code
chapter
717F.
The
department
of
natural
resources
14


licenses
hunting
preserves
which
enclose
captive-raised
game,
15


including
game
birds
and
ungulates
under
Code
chapter
484B.
16


The
bill
provides
restrictions
upon
keeping
a
boar
as
part
17


of
a
hunting
preserve,
including
maintaining
boundary
fences
18


and
posting
warning
notices
to
the
public.
The
bill
provides
19


that
a
hunting
preserve
cannot
keep
a
boar
unless
it
has
20


been
born
and
reared
in
captivity.
It
provides
that
a
boar
21


must
meet
health
requirements
of
other
swine
as
regulated
by
22


the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship.
It
also
23


provides
for
the
same
reporting
requirements
and
transportation
24


tags
as
for
other
game.
25


A
person
who
violates
a
provision
of
Code
chapter
484B
26


is
guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor.
A
simple
misdemeanor
is
27


punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
30
days
or
a
fine
of
28


at
least
$65
but
not
more
than
$625
or
by
both.
29


The
bill
takes
effect
on
the
date
that
a
declaration
by
the
30


secretary
of
agriculture
stating
that
a
hunting
preserve
may
31


confine
such
swine
is
published
in
the
Iowa
administrative
32
