an
asbestos
action,
including
16


an
action
alleging
a
malignant
condition,
or
a
silica
action
17


involving

stating
18


the

The

directs
the

a

action
without
prejudice
on
finding
that
a
plaintiff
21


has
failed
to
make
a
prima

case.
The
court
is
also
22


required
to
dismiss
an
asbestos
action
or
silica
action
without
23


prejudice
as
to
each
defendant
for
whom
a
plaintiff
lacks
24


reliable
defendant-specific
evidence
of
sufficient
exposure
to
25


asbestos
or
silica
to
create
a
reasonable
inference
that
the
26


plaintiff
may
be
entitled
to
relief.
The
court
may
dismiss
the
27


action
without
prejudice
as
to
all
defendants
if
the
plaintiff
28


fails
to
comply
with
the
requirements
for
the
sworn
statement.
29


If
a
plaintiff’s
representations
supporting
a
claim
against
30


a
defendant
are
materially
false,
the
bill
allows
the
defendant
31


to
move
the
court
to
strike
the
plaintiff’s
pleading
as
to
that
32


defendant
and
to
award
the
defendant
attorney
fees,
costs,
and
33


any
other
relief
the
court
determines
is
just
and
proper
in
the
34


circumstances.
