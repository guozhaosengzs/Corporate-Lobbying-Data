EXPLANATION
4


This
bill
relates
to
the
sales
tax
imposed
on
the
sale
of
5


tangible
personal
property
and
the
furnishing
of
enumerated
6


services
and
to
an
amendment
to
the
Constitution
of
the
State
7


of
Iowa
ratified
on
November
2,
2010,
dedicating
a
portion
of
8


state
revenue
for
purposes
of
benefiting
natural
resources,
9


outdoor
recreation,
and
soil
conservation
(Article
VII,
section
10


10).
11


The
constitutional
amendment
creates
a
natural
resources
12


and
outdoor
recreation
trust
fund
within
the
state
treasury.
13


The
fund
and
allocations
from
the
fund
are
codified
in
Code
14


chapter
461.
Moneys
in
the
fund
cannot
be
used
for
any
purpose
15


other
than
protecting
and
enhancing
water
quality
and
natural
16


areas
in
this
state
including
parks,
trails,
and
fish
and
17


wildlife
habitat,
and
conserving
agricultural
soils
in
this
18


state.
No
revenue
is
credited
to
the
fund
until
the
sales
tax
19


rate
is
increased.
Whenever
the
rate
is
increased,
the
amount
20


generated
by
the
increase
is
credited
to
the
fund,
but
the
21


amount
credited
cannot
exceed
the
amount
that
a
rate
of
3/8
of
22


1
percent
would
generate.
23


Currently,
the
tax
on
sales
and
services
in
Iowa
is
imposed
24


at
the
rate
of
6
percent.
This
bill
provides
for
an
increase
in
25


the
rate
to
6
and
3/8
percent.
26


The
bill
provides
for
the
same
increase
to
the
use
tax
27


in
order
to
comply
with
the
streamlined
sales
and
use
tax
28


agreement
of
which
Iowa
is
a
party.
The
revenues
generated
29


are
deposited
into
the
general
fund
of
the
state
before
being
30


transferred
to
the
natural
resources
and
outdoor
recreation
31


trust
fund.
The
increase
does
not
affect
those
use
taxes
32


deposited
into
other
statutory
funds,
including
the
road
use
33


tax
fund.
34


The
bill
requires
that
revenues
generated
by
the
sales
tax

The
bill
takes
effect
on
July
1,
2011,
except
for
a
provision

requiring
the

of
revenue
to
