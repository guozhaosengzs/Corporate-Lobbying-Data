EXPLANATION
3


This
bill
increases
the
membership
of
county
and
city
4


conference
boards
by
requiring
the
addition
of
four
elected
5


public
members.
The
four
public
members
are
elected
on
a
6


nonpartisan
basis
by
the
applicable
voters
of
the
county
7


or
city
at
the
general
election
or
regular
city
election,
8


as
applicable.
The
bill
provides
that
a
person
seeking
9


election
as
a
public
member
of
a
conference
board
must
only
10


file
an
affidavit
of
candidacy.
Each
public
member
seat
on
11


the
conference
board
may
only
be
held
by
an
individual
who
12


owns
or
holds
an
interest
in
taxable
property
located
in
the
13


appropriate
jurisdiction
that
is
classified
as
residential,
14


agricultural,
commercial,
or
industrial
property.
Each
of
15


the
four
property
classifications
is
assigned
to
one
of
the
16


four
public
member
seats
and
designated
as
such
on
the
ballot.
17


The
bill
provides
that
a
public
member
seat
is
not
limited
by
18


property
classification
if
that
property
classification
is
not
19


present
within
the
jurisdiction.
The
four
public
members
each
20


serve
a
four-year
term
and
may
be
reelected
for
additional
21


four-year
terms.
The
four
public
members
each
constitute
a
22


separate
voting
unit.
A
vacancy
among
the
public
member
seats
23


prior
to
the
expiration
of
a
term
is
filled
by
appointment
by
24


the
remaining
public
members
of
the
conference
board.
Such
an
25


appointment
is
for
the
period
until
the
next
pending
election.
26


By
operation
of
current
Code
section
441.3,
the
addition
27


of
the
four
public
members
to
the
conference
board
results
in
28


an
additional
four
appointments
to
the
examining
board
of
the
29


applicable
assessing
jurisdiction.
Current
Code
section
441.3
30


specifies
that
examining
board
members
serve
for
six
years.
31


However,
the
bill
provides
that
each
person
appointed
to
the
32


examining
board
by
a
public
member
serves
a
four-year
term,
33


which
is
the
same
as
the
length
of
a
public
member’s
term
on
the
34


conference
board.
