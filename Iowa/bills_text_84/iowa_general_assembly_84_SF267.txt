the

declares
a
locomotive,

or
other
facility
11


to
be
“out

an
“out
of

notice
in
a

place
on
the
locomotive,
car,
13


or
other
facility.
The
affixing
of
an
“out

notice
14


shall
constitute
legal
notice
that
the
locomotive,
car,
or
15


facility
shall
not
be
used
or
operated
until
all
defects
noted
16


on
the
“out

notice
have
been
repaired.
Such

17


shall
not
be
removed
until
the

regulations.
In

notice,
22


the
inspector
shall
furnish
immediate
telephone
or
telegraphic
23


notification
to
the
owner
of
the
track
or
facility
in
lieu
of
24


affixing
an

specific
25


location
of
the
affected
track
or
other
facility,
the
nature
of
26


the
defect,
and
related
conditions.
When
an
“out

27


notice
has
been
affixed
or
the
owner
of
the
track
has
been
28


notified,
the
inspector
shall

notice
by
the
most
29


expeditious
manner
to
the
railroad
immediately
responsible
for
30


the
operation
of
the
defective
locomotive,
car,
track,

other
31


facility.
The
notice
shall
indicate
the
nature
of
the
defects
32


involved
which
caused
the
equipment
or
other
facility
to
be
33


placed
“out

of
the
track
that
movements

the
20


locomotive,

In
the
case
of
22


track
which
is
reduced
in
class
as
provided
in
subsection
23


4,
the
railroad
shall
take
the
steps
necessary
to
insure
24


compliance
with

the
inspector.
For
the
purpose
25


of
making

cars,
or
passenger
carrying
cars
may
27


be
moved

be
repaired,
provided
that
other
similar
units
in
suitable
29


operating
condition
are
also
a
part
of
the
consist.
When
the
30


defects
noted
on
the
notice
have
been
corrected,
the
railroad
31


shall
notify
the
inspector
issuing
the

and
the

If
the
33


repairs
or

have
been
satisfactorily
completed,
the

ENFORCEMENT.
The
bill
states
that
the
close
clearance
8


and
safe
spaces
requirements
in
the
bill
apply
only
to
9


matters
under
the
purview
of
the
state
and
enforceable
by
the

department
of

and
do
not
apply
to
the
exercise
11


of
the
authority
delegated
to
state
enforcement
personnel
12


pursuant
to
federal
law.
13


The
bill
provides
that
an
inspector
authorized
by
the
14


department
may
declare
a
locomotive,
car,
or
other
facility
15


to
be
“out
of
service”
if
it
is
found
to
be
in
a
condition
16


that
poses
a
danger
to
a
person
or
property
or
might
cause
17


a
breakdown
of
equipment.
In
the
case
of
a
track
or
other
18


facility
where
it
is
not
practical
to
post
a
notice,
a
19


telephone
or
telegraphic
notification
to
the
owner
of
20


the
affected
track
or
facility
may
be
substituted.
The
21


inspector
must
also
furnish
notice
to
the
railroad
immediately
22


responsible
for
operation
of
the
defective
locomotive,
car,
23


track,
or
other
facility,
send
a
copy
of
the
notice
to
the
24


department,
and
retain
one
copy.
25


If
an
inspector
determines
the
existence
of
a
hazardous
26


local
track
condition,
the
inspector
is
required
to
order
a
27


reduction
in
the
maximum
speed
of
a
track,
with
notice
to
the
28


owner
of
the
track
or
the
owner’s
agent.
29


The
bill
outlines
the
process
for
a
railroad
to
make
30


required
repairs
to
defective
track,
locomotives,
cars,
or
31


other
facilities,
bringing
them
into
compliance
with
applicable
32


regulations
and
resulting
in
removal
of
an
“out

service”
33


notice
or
a
restriction
on
maximum
speed
imposed
by
an
34


inspector.

When
an
“out
of
service”
notice
is
issued,
a
railroad
may
1


request
a
second
inspection
and,
if
the
second
inspection
2


does
not
affirm
or
modify
the
findings
of
the
original
3


investigation,
the
second
inspector
must
immediately
remove
4


the
“out
of
service”
notice,
which
ceases
to
be
effective.
5


If
the
findings
of
the
original
inspection
are
affirmed
or
6


modified,
the
railroad
may,
within
30
days,
request
a
hearing
7


with
the
department.
The
bill
specifies
that
actions
on
review
8


may
be
prioritized
by
the
department
according
to
the
needs
9


of
the
department’s
schedule.
However,
the
requirements
of
10


an
“out
of
service”
notice
remain
effective
pending
action
11


by
the
department.
The
department
is
authorized
to
grant
a
12


request
for
an
extension
of
time
for
compliance
with
an
“out
of
13


service”
order
upon
petition
of
a
carrier
based
on
good
cause.
14


The
bill
provides
that
violations
of
close
clearance,
15


safe
space,
and
close
clearance
warning
requirements
are
16


punishable
by
a
schedule
“one”
penalty
under
the
penalty
17


schedule
applicable
to
carriers.
A
schedule
“one”
penalty
is
a
18


$100
fine.
Violations
of
enforcement
provisions
may
subject
19


the
violator
to
such
penalties
as
may
be
provided
by
other
20


law.
Each
day
of
noncompliance
with
the
requirements
of
the
21


bill
constitutes
a
separate
violation.
If
a
locomotive
or
car
22


which
was
properly
equipped
by
a
carrier
subsequently
becomes
23


defective
or
insecure,
it
may
be
hauled
to
a
nearby
location
24


for
repair,
and
the
penalties
imposed
by
the
bill
do
not
apply.
25


The
bill
requires
the
department
of
transportation
to
adopt
26


rules
it
deems
necessary
for
implementation
of
the
bill.
27


The
bill
takes
effect
January
1,
2012.
