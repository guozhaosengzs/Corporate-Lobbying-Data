EXPLANATION
7


This
bill
requires
the
licensing
of
naturopathic
physicians.
8


The
bill
provides
that
the
practice
of
naturopathic
medicine
9


means
the
provision
of
naturopathic
services
defined
as
a
10


system
of
primary
health
care
for
the
prevention,
diagnosis,
11


and
treatment
of
human
health
conditions,
injury,
and
disease,
12


and
the
promotion
or
restoration
of
health.
Naturopathic
13


medicine
includes
the
use
of
physiological,
psychological,
14


or
mechanical
methods,
and
the
use
of
natural
medicines,
15


prescription
or
legend
drugs,
foods,
herbs,
or
other
natural
16


remedies.
The
bill
specifies
qualifications
for
licensure
and
17


the
scope
of
practice
for
a
naturopathic
physician,
and
details
18


functions
that
a
naturopathic
physician
may
not
perform.
19


The
practice
of
naturopathic
medicine
is
regulated
by
the
20


board
of

with
the
advice
of
a
naturopathic

21


council.
The

consists
of
five
members,
three
of
22


whom
are
naturopathic
physicians,
one
medical
or
osteopathic
23


physician,
and
a
pharmacist.
The
council
does
not
receive
per
24


diem
or
expenses.
25


The
bill
provides
that
qualified
members
of
other
26


professions,
including
physicians
and
nurses,
are
not
prevented
27


from
providing
services
consistent
with
naturopathic
medicine,
28


but
these
persons
shall
not
use
a
title
or
description
denoting
29


that
they
are
naturopathic
physicians.
The
bill
sets
out
these
30


titles.
