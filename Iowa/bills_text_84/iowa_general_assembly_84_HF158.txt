This

owner
may
apply
to
the

treasurer
for

to

The

13


Application

and
a

may
stop
such
a
vehicle
to
determine
whether
the
driver
17


is

The

has
been
revoked
for
a
second
20


or
subsequent
time
for
operating
while
intoxicated
(OWI)
21


from
operating
a
motor
vehicle
under
a
temporary
restricted
22


driver’s
license
unless
the
vehicle
displays
restricted
23


driver
registration
plates.
The
bill
requires
that
before
24


such
a
person
is
issued
a

the
25


department
shall

Upon

the
regular
or
special

the
department
shall
issue
31


restricted
driver
registration
plates
for
each
such
vehicle.
32


Any
motor
vehicle
newly
registered
while
the
person
is
driving
33


under
a
temporary
restricted
license
for
OWI
must
also
be

A
vehicle
required
to
have
restricted
1

have
restricted
driver
8


registration

may
exchange

17


or

operating
a
vehicle
whose
restricted
driver
18


registration
plates
have
been
obscured
or

A

is
a
simple

punishable
by
confinement
20

for

24


who
operates
a
motor
vehicle
not
displaying
restricted
driver
25


registration
plates
in
violation
of
the
