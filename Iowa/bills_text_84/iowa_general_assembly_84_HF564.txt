Affect

In
the
absence

a

or

authorize
the

the

to

for

An

board
does
not
have
a
duty
to
take

action
5


if
the
executive
board
determines,
following
consideration
of
6


the
facts
and
circumstances
presented,
any
of
the
following:
7


a.
The
association’s
legal
position
does
not
justify
taking
8


any
or
further
enforcement
action.
9


b.
The
covenant,
restriction,
or
rule
being
enforced
is,
or
10


is
likely
to
be
construed
as,
inconsistent
with
law.
11


c.
Despite
the
existence
of
a
violation,
the
violation
is
12


nonmaterial
and
does
not
justify
expenditure
of
the
unit
owners
13


association
resources.
14


d.
It
is
not
in
the
unit
owners
association’s
best
interests
15


to
pursue
an
enforcement
action.

6.
The
failure
of

board
to
take
action
pursuant

shall
not
prevent

board
from

The

I
of
this
bill
creates
a
uniform
common
interest
1


ownership
Act,
new
Code
chapter
499C.
The
bill
provides
that
2


it
is
the
public
policy
of
the
state
that
the
management
and
3


affairs
of
common
interest
communities
be
conducted
to
provide
4


open
access
to
the
management
of
the
common
interest
community
5


to
the
unit
owners.
6


New
Code
chapter
499C
defines
“common
interest
community”
7


to
mean
real
estate
described
in
a
declaration
with
respect
8


to
which
a
person,
by
virtue
of
the
person’s
ownership
of
a
9


unit,
is
obligated
to
pay
for
a
share
of
real
estate
taxes,
10


insurance

15


communities.
The
bill
specifies
that
a
common
interest
16


community
does
not
include
a
covenant
that
requires
the
owners
17


of
separate
parcels
of
real
estate
to
share
certain
costs
or
18


other
obligations,
unless
all
such
owners
consent
in
writing
19


to
the
creation
of
a
common
interest
community,
and
does
not
20


include
community
where
all
units
are
owned
by
a
single
unit
21


owner.
22


The
bill
does
not
allow
for
the
provisions
of

conferred
by

499C
may
not
be
waived.
25


The

The
bill

bill
provides
that
24


the
requirements
of
new
Code
chapter
499C
relating
to
a
unit
25


owners
association
preempt
any
conflicting
provision
of
the
26


statute
under
which
the
unit
owners
association
is
organized.
27


The
bill
specifies
the
