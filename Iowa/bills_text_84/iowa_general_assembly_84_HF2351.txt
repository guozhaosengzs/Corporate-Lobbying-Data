EXPLANATION
7


GENERAL.
This
bill
is
based
in
part
on
the
Revised
Uniform
8


Law
on
Notarial
Acts
as
proposed
by
the
national
conference
9


of
commissioners
on
uniform
state
laws
(tentatively
codified
10


under
Code
chapter
9B),
repeals
the
“Iowa
Law
on
Notarial
11


Acts”
(currently
codified
under
Code
chapter
9E),
and
makes
12


conforming
changes
throughout
the
Code
concerning
notaries
13


public.
The
bill
differs
from
the
model
act
in
several
14


respects.
For
example,
it
does
not
include
optional
provisions
15


requiring
a
notary
public
to
maintain
a
journal
or
pass
an
16


examination.
The
bill
also
includes
provisions
that
are
part
17


of
the
current
law.
For
example,
it
requires
the
secretary
18


of
state
to
notify
a
notary
public
of
an
upcoming
expiration.
19


The
secretary
of
state
is
responsible
for
administering
20


requirements
applicable
to
notaries
public.
21


NOTARIAL
OFFICERS.
Under
the
bill,
a
notarial
officer
22


(a
notary
public
or
other
authorized
individual)
may
take
23


an
acknowledgment,
administer
an
oath
or
affirmation,
take
24


a
verification
on
oath
or
affirmation,
witness
or
attest
a
25


signature,
certify
or
attest
a
copy,
and
note
a
protest
of
a
26


negotiable
instrument.
The
bill
requires
a
notarial
officer
27


to
have
personal
knowledge
or
satisfactory
evidence
of
the
28


identity
of
someone
appearing
before
the
officer
for
certain
29


notarial
acts.
The
bill
requires
notaries
public
to
use
a
30


stamp,
and
sets
requirements
for
the
stamp
and
stamping
device.
31


It
establishes
qualifications
to
become
a
notary
public,
32


including
requiring
a
notary
public
to
be
a
citizen
or
legal
33


permanent
resident.
It
provides
grounds
for
the
secretary
of
34


state
to
deny,
suspend,
or
otherwise
limit
a
notary
public’s
35

appointment.
It
also
requires
a
nonattorney
notary
public
to
1


state
in
any
advertisement
that
they
are
not
authorized
to
give
2


legal
advice.
The
bill
replaces
a
reference
to
a
notarial
seal
3


with
an
official
stamp.
4


NOTARIAL
ACTS.
The
bill
provides
for
the
recognition
5


of
notarial
acts,
under
specified
procedures,
that
are
6


performed
both
within
and
outside
the
state.
It
prescribes
7


requirements
for
different
types
of
notarial
acts
as
well
as
8


certificates
that
must
be
executed
along
with
such
acts.
The
9


bill
authorizes
a
notarial
act
to
be
performed
in
Iowa
by
a
10


notary
public
or
other
designated
person
(a
judge,
clerk
or
11


deputy
clerk
of
a
court,
a
person
authorized
by
the
law
of
this
12


state
to
administer
oaths,
an
individual
authorized
to
perform
13


a
specific
act
by
the
law,
or
a
registrar
of
vital
statistics
14


or
a
designee).
Under
the
bill,
the
signature
and
title
of
15


someone
performing
a
notarial
act
is
prima
facie
evidence
that
16


the
signature
is
genuine
and
that
the
individual
holds
the
17


designated
title.
The
bill
recognizes
a
notarial
act
legally
18


performed
in
another
state,
territory,
or
insular
possession
19


of
the
United
States,
or
on
the
land
of
a
federally
recognized
20


Indian
tribe.
The
bill
specifically
applies
to
a
notarial
act
21


performed
with
respect
to
a
tangible
or
electronic
record.
It
22


requires
a
notary
public
who
wishes
to
perform
a
notarial
act
23


involving
an
electronic
record
to
notify
the
secretary
of
state
24


regarding
the
technology
that
the
notary
public
will
use.
25


RULEMAKING.
The
bill
authorizes
the
secretary
of
state
to
26


adopt
rules
necessary
to
administer
the
bill.
27


COORDINATING
AMENDMENTS.
The
bill
amends
a
number
of
28


provisions
which
refer
to
a
notary
public,
by
expressly
29


referencing
the
bill’s
new
Code
chapter.
The
affected
Code
30


chapters
include
those
relating
to
the
office
of
citizens’
31


aide,
military
justice,
elections,
vital
statistics,
health
32


care,
family
support,
transportation
and
recreation,
commercial
33


law,
court
administration,
property
conveyances,
family
law,
34


evidence,
and
probate.
