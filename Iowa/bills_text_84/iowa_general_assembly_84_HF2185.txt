EXPLANATION
16


BACKGROUND.
The
department
of
agriculture
and
land
17


stewardship
(DALS)
is
charged
to
protect
animals
including
18


livestock
from
being
afflicted
from
infectious
and
contagious
19


diseases
(Code
section
163.1).
DALS
requires
that
mature
20


equine
animals
originating
from
outside
the
state
be
21


accompanied
by
an
official
certificate
of
veterinary
inspection
22


which
includes
a
finding
that
the
animal
has
tested
negative
23


for
equine
infectious
anemia
(21
IAC
64.34(6)).
Wisconsin
24


law
allows
an
equine
animal
to
enter
the
state
without
a
25


certificate
of
veterinary
inspection
if
(1)
the
animal
26


remains
in
the
state
for
seven
days
or
less,
(2)
the
animal
27


is
accompanied
by
a
negative
infectious
anemia
test,
(3)
the
28


animal
originates
from
a
state
that
allows
animals
to
attend
29


trail
rides,
shows,
or
exhibitions,
and
(4)
the
other
state
30


provides
similar
restrictions
as
Wisconsin.
31


RECIPROCAL
ARRANGEMENT.
The
bill
provides
for
implementing
32


a
reciprocal
arrangement
between
Iowa
and
Wisconsin.
Under
the
33


bill,
an
equine
animal
may
move
from
Wisconsin
to
Iowa
subject
34


to
the
same
general
restrictions
that
would
apply
to
Iowa

equine
animals
moving
into
Wisconsin.
It
provides
rulemaking
1


authority
to
DALS,
authorizes
DALS
to
adopt
more
stringent
2


requirements
than
provided
in
the
bill,
and
requires
DALS
to
3


consult
with
the
Wisconsin
department
of
agriculture,
trade,
4


and
consumer
protection
when
adopting
the
rules.
5


SUSPENSION.
The
bill
provides
that
DALS
may
suspend
the
6


reciprocal
arrangement
if
(1)
there
is
an
outbreak
of
an
7


infectious
or
contagious
disease
afflicting
equine
animals
or
8


(2)
reciprocal
treatment
is
not
being
accorded
to
Iowa
owners
9


of
equine
animals.
10


IMPLEMENTATION.
The
bill
is
to
be
implemented
30
days
after
11


DALS
adopts
its
rules.
