The

To

needs,
the
department
10


may
temporarily
use
funds
from
the
general
fund
of
the
state
11


to
pay
expenses
in
excess
of
moneys

are

ensures
all
moneys
are

by
the

Notwithstanding

to
the

16


the

shall,
to

17


an

make

Periodic

shall

requirement.
Because
any

be
22


fully
reimbursed,
such
temporary
use
of
funds
from
the
general
23

The

as

for
this
purpose
by
the
general
assembly.
20


The
department
shall
submit
quarterly
reports
to
the
department


21


of
management
and
the
legislative
services
agency
relating
to


22

25

To
meet
the
department’s
cash
flow
needs,
the
department
26


may
temporarily
use
funds
from
the
general
fund
of
the
state
27


to
pay
expenses
in
excess
of
moneys
available
in
the
revolving
28


fund
if
those
additional
expenditures
are
fully
reimbursable
29


and
the
department
reimburses
the

of
the
state
30


and
ensures
all
moneys
are
repaid
in
full
by
the
close

year.
Notwithstanding
any
provision
of
the
law
to
the


32

in
order
to
minimize
the
use
of
moneys
from
the


33


general
fund
of
the
state,
the
department
shall

temporary
use
of

as

as
possible

in

Because
any

used
2


shall
be
fully

such
temporary
use
of
funds
from

shall

The
establishment
of
the

pursuant

this

section
shall
not
be
interpreted
in
any
manner
to
compromise
or

impact
the
accountability
of,
and
the
limitation
of
authority
14


with
respect
to,
an

Any

of,
a
division
or

office
collecting
moneys
for

into
the
fund

this
section
shall
not

and
shall
remain
applicable
to
the

extent
19


as
if
the
division
or
office
were
receiving
moneys
pursuant
20


to
an
appropriation
from

If

by

not
16


allocated
by

all

multiple

21


to
adult

both
paid
for

Replacing
