EXPLANATION
19


This
resolution
proposes
two
amendments
within
a
new
Article
20


XIII
to
the
Constitution
of
the
State
of
Iowa
which
relates
to
21


state
budgets
and
state
revenues.
22


The
first
amendment
creates
a
state
general
fund
expenditure
23


limitation.
The
amount
of
the
limitation
is
99
percent
of
the
24


adjusted
revenue
estimate.
The
amendment
defines
adjusted
25


revenue
estimate
and
requires
that
that
estimate
be
determined
26


by
a
revenue
estimating
conference
which
is
to
be
created
by
27


the
general
assembly
by
law.
The
amendment
requires
that
the
28


expenditure
limitation
be
used
by
the
governor
in
preparation
29


of
the
governor’s
budget
and
by
the
general
assembly
in
the
30


budget
process.
The
governor
is
prohibited
from
approving
or
31


disapproving
of
appropriations
in
a
manner
that
would
cause
the
32


final
budget
approved
by
the
governor
to
exceed
the
expenditure
33


limitation.
34


The
first
amendment
also
provides
that
if
a
new
revenue

established
and
implemented,
95
percent
of
the
1


estimate
of
that
new
revenue
shall
be
included
in
the
2


expenditure
limitation.
3


The
first
amendment
provides
that
if
there
is
a
surplus
4


existing
at
the
end
of
a
fiscal
year
which
exceeds
10
percent
5


of
the
adjusted
revenue
for
the
fiscal
year
and
the
actual
6


net
revenue
for
the
general
fund
for
the
fiscal
year
exceeds
7


the
adjusted
revenue
estimate
for
the
fiscal
year,
a
portion
8


of
the
surplus
is
required
to
be
transferred
to
a
taxpayers
9


trust
fund.
The
maximum
transfer
amount
is
required
to
be
10


established
by
statute
but
cannot
be
less
than
1
percent
of
the
11


adjusted
revenue
estimate
for
the
fiscal
year.
After
taking
12


into
account
any
anticipated
transfer
to
the
taxpayers
trust
13


fund,
the
remaining
amount
of
any
surplus
anticipated
to
exceed
14


10
percent
of
the
adjusted
revenue
estimate
is
required
to
be
15


included
in
the
adjusted
revenue
estimate
for
the
following
16


fiscal
year.
Any
surplus
which
is
equal
to
10
percent
or
less
17


of
the
amount
of
the
adjusted
revenue
estimate
may
be
included
18


in
the
following
year’s
adjusted
revenue
estimate
if
inclusion
19


is
approved
in
a
bill
by
at
least
three-fifths
of
the
members
20


elected
to
each
house
of
the
general
assembly.
21


The
first
amendment
requires

or
22


joint
resolution
providing
for
new
or
expanded
authority
to
23


issue
revenue
or

or
in
24


part
from
revenues
from
the
general
fund
or
from
another

treasury
requires
a
vote
of
at
least
26


two-thirds
of
the
members
elected
to
each
house
of
the
general
27


assembly.
In
addition,
the
appropriations
of
such
revenues
are
28


required
to
be
included
in
the
state
general
fund
expenditure
29


limitation
for
each
applicable
fiscal
year.

amendment
also
requires
the
state
to

generally
31


accepted
accounting
principles
for
state
budgeting
and
