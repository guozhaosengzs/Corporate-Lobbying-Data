A

the

an
ATE
system
is
in

The
signage
must

with
the
uniform
system
adopted
by
the
state.
The
bill
10


specifies
that
signs
giving
notice
of
an
ATE
system
being
used
11


for
speed
limit
enforcement
must
be
positioned

adequate

speed
limit
before
entering
the
range
of

an
22


affidavit

on
the
fine
amounts
that

with
the
department
of
public

comparing
the
