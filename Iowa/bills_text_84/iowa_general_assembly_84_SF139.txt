findings.
16


The
general
assembly
finds
that
increasing
the
ease
of
17


public
access
to
state
and
local
tax
rates,
particularly
18


where
the
rates
are
currently
available
from
disparate
19


government
sources
and
are
difficult
for
the
public
to
collect
20


and
efficiently
aggregate,
significantly
contributes
to
21


governmental
accountability,
public
participation,
and
the
22


understanding
of
the
cost
of
government
services.
Therefore,
23


it
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
direct
the
24


department
of
management,
in
consultation
with
the

25


of
revenue,
to
create

maintain
a

EXPLANATION

This

requires
the
department
of
30


management
to

by
31


January
1,
2013,
a

and
32


internet

internet
site
would
allow

internet

is

The
