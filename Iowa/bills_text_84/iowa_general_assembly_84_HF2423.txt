This

applies
when
a

holds
an
16


interest
in
minerals
and

instrument
creates
an
interest
in
17


minerals.
In
that
case,
no
action
based
upon
any
claim
arising
18


from
such
instrument
can
be
maintained
in
court
against
the
19


holder
of
record
title
to
the
real
estate
after
21
years
from
20


the
instrument’s
execution
unless
the
railroad
corporation
21


files
a
verified
claim
with
the
recorder
of
the
county
where
22


the
real
estate
is
located
within
the
21-year
period.
If
the
23


instrument
was
executed
more
than
20
years
prior
to
July
1,
24


2012,
then
such
claim
may
be
filed
on
or
before
June
30,
2015.
25


The
bill
does
not
affect
interests
in
coal
or
the
validity
26


of
environmental
covenants,
or
revive
an
interest
which
has
27


expired
or
been
terminated.
