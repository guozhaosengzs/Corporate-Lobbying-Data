19


mental
illness,
mental
retardation


an
intellectual
disability
,
20


developmental

autonomous

22


service
providers
working
cooperatively
with
state
and

officials.
However,
the

recognizes
that
heavy
24


reliance
on
property
tax
funding
for
mental
health
and
mental


25


retardation


intellectual
disability
services
has
enabled
many
26


counties
to
exceed
minimum
state
standards
for
the
services
27


resulting
in
an
uneven
level
of
services
around
the
state.
28


Consequently,
greater
efforts
should
be
made
to
assure
ensure
29


close
coordination
and
continuity
of
care
for
those
persons
30


receiving

EXPLANATION
20


This
bill
replaces
the
terms
“mental
retardation”
and
21


“mentally
retarded”
with
the
term
“intellectual
disability”
22


throughout
the
Iowa
Code.
23


The
bill
defines
“intellectual
disability”
for
the
entire
24


Iowa
Code
as
a
disability
of
children
and
adults
who
as
25


a
result
of
inadequately
developed
intelligence
have
a
26


significant
impairment
in
ability
to
learn
or
to
adapt
to
27


the
demands
of
society.
This
is
the
current
definition
of
28


“mental
retardation”
in
Code
chapter
222.
The
bill
also
29


provides
for
the
entire
Iowa
Code
that
if
a
diagnosis
is
30


required,
“intellectual
disability”
means
a
diagnosis
of
mental
31


retardation
as
defined
in
the
diagnostic
and
statistical
manual
32


of
mental
disorders,
fourth
edition,
text
revised,
published
by
33


the
American
psychiatric
association.
This
language
currently
34


exists
in
Code
section
222.60.
