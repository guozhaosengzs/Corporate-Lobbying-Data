c.


In

implement

intent
stated
in

and

that
priority
for
home
visitation


program
funding
be
given
to
programs
using
evidence-based
or


promising
models
for
home
visitation,
it
is
the
intent
of
the


general
assembly
to
phase
in
the
funding
priority
as
follows:


(1)
By
July
1,
2013,
25
percent
of
state
funds
expended


for
home
visiting
programs
are
for
evidence-based
or
promising


program
models.


(2)
By
July
1,
2014,
50
percent
of
state
funds
expended


for
home
visiting
programs
are
for
evidence-based
or
promising


program
models.


(3)
By
July
1,
2015,
75
percent
of
state
funds
expended


for
home
visiting
programs
are
for
evidence-based
or
promising


program
models.


(4)
By
July
1,
2016,
90
percent
of
state
funds
expended


for
home
visiting
programs
are
for
evidence-based
or
promising


program
models.
The
remaining
10
percent
of
funds
may
be


used
for
innovative
program
models
that
do
not
yet
meet
the


definition
of
evidence-based
or
promising
programs.


d.
For
the
purposes
of
this
subsection,
unless
the
context


requires:


(1)
“Evidence-based
program”
means
a
program
that
is
based


on
scientific
evidence
demonstrating
that
the
program
model


is
effective.
An
evidence-based
program
shall
be
reviewed


on
site
and
compared
to
program
model
standards
by
the
model


developer
or
the
developer’s
designee
at
least
every
five
years


to
ensure
that
the
program
continues
to
maintain
fidelity


with
the
program
model.
The
program
model
shall
have
had















































Senate
File

p.

demonstrated
significant
and
sustained
positive
outcomes
in
an


evaluation
utilizing
a
well-designed
and
rigorous
randomized


controlled
research
design
or
a
quasi-experimental
research


design,
and
the
evaluation
results
shall
have
been
published
in


a
peer-reviewed
journal.


(2)
“Family
support
programs”
includes
group-based
parent


education
or
home
visiting
programs
that
are
designed
to


strengthen
protective
factors,
including
parenting
skills,


increasing
parental
knowledge
of
child
development,
and


increasing
family
functioning
and
problem
solving
skills.
A


family
support
program
may
be
used
as
an
early
intervention


strategy
to
improve
birth
outcomes,
parental
knowledge,
family


economic
success,
the
home
learning
environment,
family
and


child
involvement
with
others,
and
coordination
with
other


community
resources.
A
family
support
program
may
have
a


specific
focus
on
preventing
child
maltreatment
or
ensuring


children
are
safe,
healthy,
and
ready
to
succeed
in
school.


(3)
“Promising
program”
means
a
program
that
meets
all
of


the
following
requirements:


(a)
The
program
conforms
to
a
clear,
consistent
family


support
model
that
has
been
in
existence
for
at
least
three


years.


(b)
The
program
is
grounded
in
relevant
empirically-based


knowledge.


(c)
The
program
is
linked
to
program-determined
outcomes.


(d)
The
program
is
associated
with
a
national
or
state


organization
that
either
has
comprehensive
program
standards


that
ensure
high-quality
service
delivery
and
continuous


program
quality
improvement
or
the
program
model
has


demonstrated
through
the
program’s
benchmark
outcomes
that
the


program
has
achieved
significant
positive
outcomes
equivalent


to
those
achieved
by
program
models
with
published
significant


and
sustained
results
in
a
peer-reviewed
journal.


(e)
The
program
has
been
awarded
the
Iowa
family
support


credential
and
has
been
reviewed
on
site
at
least
every
five


years
to
ensure
the
program’s
adherence
to
the
Iowa
family


support
standards
approved
by
the
early
childhood
Iowa


state
board
created
in
section
256I.3
or
a
comparable
set
of


standards.
The
on-site
review
is
completed
by
an
independent


review
team
that
is
not
associated

or

organization
