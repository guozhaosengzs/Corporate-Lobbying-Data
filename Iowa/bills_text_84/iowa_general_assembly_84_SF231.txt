statutes.
If
the
agency
determines
that
completion
of
the
1


review
of
existing
rules
is
not
feasible
by
July
1,
2013,


2


the
agency
shall
publish
notice
of
that
finding
in
the
Iowa
3


administrative
bulletin.
The
agency
may
then
extend
the
4


completion
date
by
one
year
at
a
time
for
a
total
of
not
more
5


than
five
years.
In
reviewing
rules
to
minimize

on
small

shall


7


consider
all
of
the
following
factors:
8


a.
The
continued
need
for
the
rule.
9


b.
The
nature
of
complaints
or
comments
received
concerning
10


the
rule
from
the
public.
11


c.
The
complexity
of
the
rule.
12


d.
The
extent
to
which
the
rule
overlaps,
duplicates,
or
13


conflicts
with
other
federal,
state,
or
local
governmental
14


statutes
or
rules.
15


e.
The
length
of
time
since
the
rule
has
been
evaluated
or
16


the
degree
to
which
technology,
economic
conditions,
or
other


17


factors
have
changed
in
the
area
affected
by
the
rule.
18


EXPLANATION
19


Code
section
17A.4A
sets
out
a
procedure
for
requesting
a
20


regulatory
analysis
for
proposed
rules
or
rules
adopted
without
21


notice.
This
analysis
is
essentially
a
cost/benefit
study
22


identifying
the
impact
of
a
rule
on
the
affected
public
and,
23


in
the
case
of
a
rule
that
would
have
a
substantial
impact
24


on
small
business,
the
regulatory
analysis
must
contain
a
25


discussion
of
whether
it
would
be
feasible
and
practicable
to
26


reduce
the
impact
of
the
rule
on
small
business.
27


This
bill
requires
an
analysis
on
every
new
rule
which
has
an
28


adverse
impact
on
small
business
and
requires
the
analysis
to
29


be
published
in
the
Iowa
administrative
bulletin
along
with
the
30


new
rule.
If
an
agency
determines
that
it
would
not
be
legal
31


and
feasible
to
reduce
the
adverse
impact
on
small
business,
a
32


small
business
would
have
judicial
standing
to
challenge
that
33


determination
in
district
court.
The
bill
also
requires
a
34


periodic
review
of
all
rules
to
minimize
the
economic
impact
of
