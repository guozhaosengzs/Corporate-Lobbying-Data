resources
during

Legislative

Session
to
a

The

10


general

This
transfer
is
consistent
with
responsibilities
12


previously
held
by
the
position
of
commerce
counsel,
under
the
13


administration
of
what
is

advocate.
The

bill
also
clarifies
that
the
Iowa
energy
regulatory
board
shall
16


be
responsible
for
representing
consumer
interests
in
electric,
17


gas,
and
telephone
regulatory
issues
at

state
and
federal

level
in
addition
to
current
responsibilities
charged
to
the

utilities
board
in
Code
section

In

to
transferring
energy

and

advocate,
to
the
Iowa
energy
24


regulatory
board,
the
bill
changes
all
Code
references
from
25


“Iowa
utilities
board”
or
“utilities
board”
to
“Iowa
energy
26


regulatory

or
