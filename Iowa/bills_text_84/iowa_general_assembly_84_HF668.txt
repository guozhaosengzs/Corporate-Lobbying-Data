EXPLANATION
15


This

creates

investment
loans

businesses
program.

to
an
eligible
lending
institution
for
a
loan,
21


and
the
lending
institution
seeks
a

from
the
22


department
of
economic
development.

department
come
from
the

An

is
a

25


empowered
to

and
eligible
to

If
a
lending
institution
wishes
to
receive
a
linked
4


investment,
the
lending
institution
must
send
a
loan
package
5


to
the
department
for
review.
The
department
may
negotiate
6


the
terms
of
the
linked
investment
and
accept
a
certificate
of
7


deposit
from
the
lending
institution.
The
lending
institution
8


must
agree
to
loan
an
amount
at
least
equal
to
the
value
of
9


the
certificate
of
deposit
to
the
eligible
borrower.
The
10


annualized
interest
rate
on
the
certificate
of
deposit
is
11


negotiable
but
cannot
be
less
than
one-half
of
1
percent.
12


The
loan
to
the
eligible
borrower
cannot
be
at
a
rate
of
13


interest
more
than
4
percent
above
the
rate
of
the
department’s
14


certificate
of
deposit.
15


The
linked
investments
do
not
constitute
the
payment
of
a
16


business
debt
by
the
state
nor
do
they
pledge
the
credit
or
17


taxing
power
of
the
state.
18


The
department
is
directed
to
adopt
rules
for
the
19


administration
of
the
program.
