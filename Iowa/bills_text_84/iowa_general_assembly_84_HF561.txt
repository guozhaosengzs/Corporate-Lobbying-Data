NEW
PARAGRAPH


.
d.
A
rate-regulated
electric
utility
that
3


was
subject
to
a
revenue
sharing
settlement
agreement
with
4


regard
to
its
electric
base
rates
as
of
January

for
ratemaking
principles
applicable
to
6


the
construction
of
a
nuclear

facility
with
the

The
application
shall
comply
with
the

Electric
generating
and
transmission
facilities.
15


1.
It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
attract
16


the
development
of
electric
power
generating
and
transmission
17


facilities
within
the
state
in
sufficient
quantity
to
ensure
18


reliable
electric
service
to
Iowa
consumers
and
provide
19


economic
benefits
to
the
state.
It
is
also
the
intent
of
the
20


general
assembly
to
encourage
rate-regulated
public
utilities
21


to
consider
altering
existing
electric
generating
facilities,
22


where
reasonable,
to
manage
carbon
emission
intensity
in
23


order
to
facilitate
the
transition
to
a
carbon-constrained
24


environment.
25


2.


a.
The
general
assembly’s
intent
with
regard
to
the
26


development
of
electric
power
generating
and
transmission
27


facilities,
or
the
significant
alteration
of
an
existing
28


generating
facility,
as
provided
in
this
subsection
1
,
shall
be
29


implemented
in
a
manner
that
is
cost-effective
and
compatible
30


with
the
environmental
policies
of
the
state,
as
expressed
in
31


Title
XI
.
32


b.
The
general
assembly’s
intent
with
regard
to
the
33


reliability
of
electric
service
to
Iowa
consumers,
as
provided
34


in
this


subsection

,
shall
be
implemented
by

diversity
of
the
types
of
fuel
used
to
generate
electricity,

the
availability
and
reliability
of
fuel
supplies,
and
the
2


impact
of
the
volatility
of
fuel
costs.

a
.
It
is
also
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
4


encourage
the
safe
and
prudent
development
of
baseload
nuclear
5


electric
power
generation,
at
a
reasonable
cost
to
ratepayers.


6


Nuclear
generation
has
a
long-term
proven
record
of
providing
a


7


safe,
reliable,
and
secure
source
of
electricity
in
the
United
8


States
and
offers
the
potential
for
significant
job
creation,
9


substantial
economic
development
benefits,
and
the
production
10


of
electricity
at
significantly
reduced
levels
of
regulated
11


air
emissions
when
compared
to
output
from
other
thermal
12


generation
sources.
Further,
the
general
assembly
recognizes
13


that
meeting
stringent
environmental
permit
and
public
health
14


and
safety
requirements
is
expensive
and
creates
significant
15


cost
burdens
on
customers
and
employers
attributable
to
the
16


imposition
of
additional
comprehensive
and
costly
regulations


17


by
the
United
States
environmental
protection
agency
that
18


dramatically
increase
costs
to
customers.
Finally,
the
general
19


assembly
recognizes
that
development
of
nuclear
electric
power
20


generation
requires
significant
capital
investment,
ongoing


21


operating
expenses,
and
decommissioning
expenses,
including


22


storage
or
disposal
of
used
nuclear
fuel,
and
a
substantial
23


period
of
time
for
successful
nuclear
generation
development,
24


siting,
permitting,
licensing,
and
deployment.


25


b.


The
general
assembly
recognizes
that
to
maximize
the
26


potential
for
significant
job
creation,
economic
development,
27


and
competitive
advantage
derived
from
a
robust
nuclear
28


industry,
a
significant
workforce
is
required
to
construct
and
29


operate
new
nuclear
power
plants.
Such
jobs
include
skilled
30


trades,
such
as
welders,
pipe
fitters,
masons,
carpenters,


31


millwrights,
sheet
metal
workers,
electricians,
and
heavy


32


equipment
operators,
in
addition
to
nuclear
reactor
operators,


33


radiation
protection
specialists,
and
nuclear,
mechanical,
and


34


electrical
engineers.
In
order

in
developing
this
skilled
workforce
and
to
maximize
1


economic
development
related
to

electric
power

generation,
the
general
assembly
intends
for
the
state
to
3


undertake
the
following:
4


(1)
Create
and
implement
plans
to
assess
and
enhance
5


educational
and
training
systems
to
develop
a
next-generation


6


nuclear
workforce.


7


(2)
Assess
the
adequacy
and
potential
expansion
of
supply
8


chain
infrastructure
to
support
the
growing
nuclear
industry.
9


(3)
Recommend
steps
to
attract
new
nuclear-related
10


businesses.
11


(4)
Evaluate
the
economic
development
impact
affordable

nuclear
electric

generation
will
have
on
the
expansion
13


and
retention
of

this
cap,
or
it
is
anticipated
it
will
exceed
this
cap,
the
1


rate-regulated
utility
may
provide
a
rationale
to
the
board


2


as
to
why
the
actual
capital
structure
is
reasonable
for

maintaining
its

attracting
capital
on
reasonable
terms,
4


and
results
in
reasonable
costs
to
the
rate-regulated

retail
customers.
The
board
shall
rule
upon
any
such
request


6


in
a
contested
case
proceeding.


7


(d)
Allow
the
utility
to
recover
return
on
and
a
return
of
8


all
prudent
preconstruction
and
construction
costs
incurred
9


if
the
utility
elects
not
to
complete
or
is
precluded
from
10


completing
construction
of
the
nuclear
generating
facility.

Costs
determined
to
be
prudent
in
prior
annual
review
12


proceedings
shall
not
subsequently
be
redetermined
to
be
13


imprudent.
The
utility
shall
recover
such
costs
over
a
period
14


not
to
exceed
the
sum
of
the
estimated
construction
period
for
15


a
nuclear
unit
plus
its
useful
life
as
determined
by
the
board.

(e)


Allow
the
utility
to
recover
the
net

value
of
any
17


coal-fired
generating
facility
entered
into
service
prior
to
18


1974
and
owned
by
the
utility
as
of
January
1,
2010,
that
the
19


utility
commits
to
retire
in
anticipation
of
the
operation
20


of
a
new
nuclear
generating
facility,
and
that
the
board


21


determines
to
be
prudent.
The
board
shall
allow
for
the


22


recovery
of
a
return
on,
and
a
return
of
the
book
value
of,
the
23


retired
generating
facility
over
a
period
not
greater
than
the
24


remaining
useful
life
of
the
facility
prior
to
a
determination


25


to

the

26


c.
In
determining
the
applicable
ratemaking
principles,
the
27


board
shall
make
the
following
findings:
28


(1)
The
rate-regulated
public
utility
has
in
effect
a
29


board-approved
energy
efficiency
plan
as
required
under
section
30


476.6,
subsection
16
.
31


(2)
The


Except
for
an
application
for
ratemaking
principles
32


subject
to
paragraph


“a”
,
subparagraph
(2),
the
rate-regulated
33


public
utility
has
demonstrated
to
the
board
that
the
public
34


utility
has
considered
other
sources
for
long-term

supply
and
that
the
facility
or
lease
is
reasonable
when
1


compared
to
other
feasible
alternative
sources
of
supply.
The
2


rate-regulated
public
utility
may
satisfy
the
requirements
of
3


this
subparagraph
through
a
competitive
bidding
process,
under
4


rules
adopted
by
the
board,
that
demonstrate
the
facility
or
5


lease
is
a
reasonable
alternative
to
meet
its
electric
supply
6


needs.
7


(3)


For
an
application
for
ratemaking
principles
subject
8


to
paragraph
“a”
,
subparagraph
(2),
the
rate-regulated
utility
9


has
demonstrated
through
a
detailed
business
case
filed
with
10


the
board
that
it
is
prudent
to
build
the
proposed
nuclear
11


generating
facility.
12


d.
The
applicable
ratemaking
principles
shall
be
determined
13


in
a
contested
case
proceeding,
which
proceeding
may
be
14


combined
with
the
proceeding
for
issuance
of
a
certificate
15


conducted
pursuant
to
chapter
476A
.
16


e.
The
order
setting
forth
the
applicable
ratemaking
17


principles
shall
be
issued
prior
to
the
commencement
of
18


construction
or
lease
of
the
facility.
19


f.
Following
issuance
of
the
order,
the
rate-regulated
20


public
utility
shall
have
the
option
of
proceeding
according
to
21


either
of
the
following:
22


(1)
Withdrawing
its
application
for
a
certificate
pursuant
23


to
chapter
476A
or
withdrawing
its
ratemaking
principles


24


application


.
25


(2)
Proceeding
with
the
construction
or
lease
of
the
26


facility
or
efforts
to
pursue
a
United

or
license
.
28


g.
Notwithstanding
any
provision
of
this
chapter
to
the
29


contrary,
the
ratemaking
principles
established
by
the
order
30


issued
pursuant
to
paragraph
“e”
shall
be
binding
with
regard
31


to
the

subsequent
rate
proceeding.
