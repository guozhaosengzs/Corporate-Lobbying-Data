EXPLANATION
27


This
bill
amends
Iowa’s
fence
law
(Code
chapter
359A)
which
28


in
part
provides
that
the
respective
owners
of
adjoining
tracts
29


of
land
must
upon
written
“request”
(i.e.,
demand)
of
either
30


owner
erect
and
maintain
a
partition
fence
or
contribute
to
its
31


erection
and
maintenance
(Code
section
359A.1A).
The
modern
32


version
of
the
requirement
can
be
traced
to
1921
Iowa
Acts,
ch.
33


76.
The
provision
does
not
distinguish
between
rural
or
urban
34


areas
or
refer
to
livestock.

The
bill
provides
that
if
one
owner
keeps
livestock
on
the
1


adjoining
tract
of
land,
that
owner
has
the
sole
responsibility
2


to
erect
and
maintain
the
partition
fence
upon
the
written
3


demand
of
the
other
owner.
If
an
owner
who
did
not
contribute
4


to
the
erection
and
maintenance
of
a
fence
begins
keeping
5


livestock
on
that
owner’s
land
after
the
fence
is
erected,
that
6


owner
must
pay
the
adjoining
owner
50
percent
of
the
costs
7


incurred
in
erecting
the
partition
fence.
The
respective
8


owners
are
both
to
be
responsible
for
maintaining
the
partition
9


fence
for
as
long
as
they
both
keep
livestock
on
their
10


respective
land.
If
either
owner
no
longer
keeps
livestock
11


on
that
owner’s
land
for
five
years,
that
owner
may
terminate
12


participation
by
delivering
a
written
notice
to
the
other
13


owner.
The
bill
does
not
restrict
the
right
of
landowners
14


to
execute
agreements
which
supplement
or
depart
from
these
15


statutory
requirements.
16


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
