Section
1.
FINDINGS.
The
general
assembly
finds
all
of
the
1


following:
2


1.
Abortion
can
cause
serious
short-term
and
long-term
3


physical
and
psychological
complications
for
women
including
4


but
not
limited
to
uterine
perforation,
uterine
scarring,
5


cervical
perforation
or
other
injury,
infection,
bleeding,
6


hemorrhage,
blood
clots,
failure
to
actually
terminate
the
7


pregnancy,
incomplete
abortion
or
retained
tissue,
pelvic
8


inflammatory
disease,
endometritis,
missed
ectopic
pregnancy,
9


cardiac
arrest,
respiratory
arrest,
renal
failure,
metabolic
10


disorder,
shock,
embolism,
coma,
placenta
previa
in
subsequent
11


pregnancies,
preterm
delivery
in
subsequent
pregnancies,
12


free
fluid
in
the
abdomen,
organ
damage,
adverse
reactions
13


to
anesthesia
and
other
drugs,
psychological
or
emotional
14


complications
such
as
depression,
anxiety,
sleeping
disorders,
15


and
death.
16


2.
Abortion
has
a
higher
medical
risk
when
the
procedure
is
17


performed
later
in
the
pregnancy.
Compared
to
an
abortion
at
18


eight
weeks’
gestation
or
earlier,
the
relative
risk
increases
19


exponentially
at
higher
gestations.
The
incidence
of
major
20


complications
is
highest
after
twenty
weeks
of
gestation.
21


3.
The
state
has
a
legitimate
concern
for
the
public’s
22


health
and
safety.
23


4.
The
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
from
the
outset
24


of
pregnancy
in
protecting
the
health
of
the
woman.
More
25


specifically,
the
state
has
a
legitimate
concern
with
the
26


health
of
women
who
undergo
abortions.
27


5.
There
is
substantial
evidence
that
by
at
least
twenty
28


weeks
after
fertilization,
an
unborn
child
has
the
physical
29


structures
necessary
to
experience
pain.
30


6.
There
is
substantial
evidence
that
by
twenty
weeks
31


after
fertilization,
an
unborn
child
seeks
to
evade
certain
32


stimuli
in
a
manner
which,
in
an
infant
or
an
adult,
would
be
33


interpreted
as
a
response
to
pain.
34


7.
Anesthesia
is
routinely
administered
to
an
unborn
child
35

H.F.
657


twenty
weeks
or
more
after
fertilization
when
the
unborn
child
1


undergoes
prenatal
surgery.
2


8.
Even
before
twenty
weeks
after
fertilization,
the
unborn
3


child
has
been
observed
to
exhibit
hormonal
stress
responses
to
4


painful
stimuli,
and
a
reduction
in
such
response
results
when
5


pain
medication
is
administered
directly
to
the
unborn
child.
6


9.
It
is
the
purpose
of
the
state
of
Iowa
to
assert
a
7


compelling
state
interest
in
protecting
the
unborn
child
from
8


the
stage
at
which
substantial
medical
evidence
indicates
the
9


unborn
child
is
capable
of
feeling
pain.

shall

21


EXPLANATION
22


This
bill
relates
to
abortions.
The
bill
provides
findings
23


of
the
general
assembly
and
definitions.
24


The
bill
provides
that,
except
in
the
case
of
a
medical
25


emergency,
an
abortion
shall
not
be
performed
or
induced
26


or
be
attempted
to
be
performed
or
induced
unless
the
27


physician
performing
or
inducing
the
abortion
has
first
made
28


a
determination
of
the
probable
postfertilization
age
of
the
29


unborn
child.
Additionally,
the
bill
prohibits
a
physician
30


from
performing
or
inducing
or
attempting
to
perform
or
induce
31


an
abortion
upon
a
pregnant
woman
when
it
has
been
determined,
32


that
the
probable
postfertilization
age
is
20
or
more
weeks
33


unless,
in
the
physician’s
reasonable
medical
judgment,
either
34


the
pregnant
woman
has
a
condition
which
the
physician
deems
a
35

H.F.
657


medical
emergency
or
it
is
necessary
to
preserve
the
life
of
1


the
unborn
child.
If
an
abortion
is
performed
or
induced
when
2


the
probable
postfertilization
age
is
20
or
more
weeks,
the
3


physician
is
required
to
terminate
the
pregnancy
in
a
manner
4


which,
in
the
physician’s
reasonable
medical
judgment,
provides
5


the
best
opportunity
for
the
unborn
child
to
survive
unless
6


such
termination
would
pose
a
greater
risk
either
of
the
death
7


of
the
pregnant
woman
or
of
the
substantial
and
irreversible
8


physical
impairment
of
a
major
bodily
function
of
the
woman
9


than
would
another
available
method.
10


The
bill
also
requires
certain
reports
to
be
filed
by
a
11


physician
who
performs
or
induces
or
attempts
to
perform
or
12


induce
an
abortion
with
the
department
of
public
health,
on
13


a
schedule
and
in
accordance
with
forms
and
rules
adopted
by
14


the
department.
The
department
is
required
to
compile
the
15


information
collected
annually
and
issue
a
public
report,
16


ensuring
that
none
of
the
information
included
in
the
public
17


reports
could
reasonably
lead
to
the
identification
of
any
18


pregnant
woman
upon
whom
an
abortion
was
performed.
The
bill
19


provides
monetary
penalties
for
a
physician
who
fails
to
submit
20


a
report
in
a
timely
manner,
submits
an
incomplete
report,
or
21


intentionally
or
recklessly
falsifies
a
required
report.
22


The
bill
provides
for
civil
and
criminal
actions
and
23


penalties
relating
to
violations
of
the
bill.
Failure
of
a
24


physician
to
comply
with
any
provision,
with
the
exception
of
25


the
late
filing
of
a
report
or
failure
to
submit
a
complete
26


report
in
compliance
with
a
court
order,
is
grounds
for
license
27


discipline.
A
physician
who
intentionally
or
recklessly
28


performs
or
attempts
to
perform
an
abortion
in
violation
of
29


the
bill
is
guilty
of
a
class
“C”
felony,
which
is
punishable
30


by
confinement
for
no
more
than
10
years
and
a
fine
of
at
31


least
$1,000
but
not
more
than
$10,000.
However,
the
woman
32


upon
whom
the
abortion
was
performed
or
was
attempted
to
be
33


performed
is
not
subject
to
prosecution
for
a
violation
of
34


the
bill.
The
bill
provides
for
the
maintaining
of
actions

by
certain
people
based
on
alleged
violations
of
the
bill.
A
1


woman
upon
whom
an
abortion
has
been
performed
in
violation
2


of
the
bill
or
the
biological
father
may
maintain
an
action
3


against
the
physician
who
performed
the
abortion
in
intentional
4


or
reckless
violation
of
the
bill
for
actual
damages.
However,
5


the
bill
is
not
to
be
interpreted
to
apply
to
a
biological
6


father
when
the
pregnancy
is
the
result
of
rape
or
incest.
A
7


woman
upon
whom
an
abortion
has
been
attempted
in
violation
8


of
the
bill
may
maintain
an
action
against
the
physician
who
9


attempted
to
perform
the
abortion
in
intentional
or
reckless
10


violation
of
the
bill
for
actual
damages.
Additionally,
a
11


cause
of
action
for
injunctive
relief
to
prevent
a
physician
12


from
performing
abortions
may
be
maintained
against
a
physician
13


who
has
intentionally
violated
the
bill
by
the
woman
upon
whom
14


the
abortion
was
performed
or
attempted
to
be
performed,
by
the
15


spouse
of
the
woman,
by
a
parent
or
guardian
of
the
woman
if
16


the
woman
is
less
than
18
years
of
age
or
unmarried
at
the
time
17


the
abortion
was
performed
or
attempted
to
be
performed,
by
a
18


current
or
former
licensed
health
care
provider
of
the
woman,
19


by
a
county
attorney
with
appropriate
jurisdiction,
or
by
the
20


attorney
general.
21


The
bill
provides
a
process
for
preserving
the
anonymity
of
22


the
woman
upon
whom
an
abortion
has
been
performed
or
attempted
23


from
public
disclosure
if
the
woman
does
not
provide
consent
to
24


such
disclosure
during
any
proceeding
or
action
under
the
bill.
25


The
bill
also
provides
that
the
bill
is
not
to
be
construed
26


as
creating
or
recognizing
a
right
to
an
abortion,
and
the
27


bill
is
not
to
be
construed
as
determining
life
to
begin
at
20
28


weeks’
gestation;
instead,
it
is
recognized
that
life
begins
29


at
fertilization.
30


The
bill
includes
a
severability
clause
as
is
applicable
to
31


every
Act
or
statute
pursuant
to
Code
section
4.12.
32


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
