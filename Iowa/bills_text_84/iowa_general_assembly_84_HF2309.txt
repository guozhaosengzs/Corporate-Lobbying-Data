This

relates
to
the

licensing.
The

section

to
increase
27


the
time
period

an

valid
from
one
28


to
two
years
after
the
individual
has
been
licensed
for
an
29


initial
two-year
period.
However,
the
bill
provides
that
an
30


administrator
of
the
department
of
human
services
as
defined
by
31


Code
chapter
237
may
require
annual
renewal
of
the
individual
32


license
or
may
issue
a
provisional
license
even
after
this
33


initial
two-year
period
of
licensure
within
the
administrator’s
34


discretion
based
upon
the
performance
of
the
licensee.
