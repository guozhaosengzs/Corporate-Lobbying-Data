EXPLANATION
7


This
bill
contains
various
provisions
relating
to
the
8


funding
of
Iowa
roads.
9


DIVISION
I
——
MOTOR
FUEL
TAX.
The
bill
increases
the
excise
10


tax
on
motor
fuel
and
special
fuel
used
in
motor
vehicles,
11


other
than
biodiesel
blended
fuel
classified
as
B-10
or
higher,
12


by
five
cents
beginning
January
1,
2013,
and
by
an
additional
13


five
cents
beginning
January
1,
2014.
The
additional
revenues
14


shall
be
credited
to
the
TIME-21
fund,
subject
to
the
statutory
15


limitation
on
annual
deposits
to
that
fund.
After
the
repeal
16


of
the
TIME-21
fund
on
June
30,
2028,
the
revenues
will
accrue
17


to
the
road
use
tax
fund.
18


The
bill
provides
that
the
distribution
percentage
formula
19


for
determining
the
difference
in
the
excise
tax
imposed
on
20


ethanol
blended
gasoline
and
motor
fuel
other
than
ethanol
21


blended
gasoline,
which
is
due
to
expire
on
June
30,
2012,
is
22


extended
until
June
30,
2022.
23


Pursuant
to
current
law,
when
the
rate
of
excise
tax
on
24


motor
fuel,
ethanol
blended
gasoline,
undyed
special
fuel,
25


compressed
natural
gas,
or
liquefied
petroleum
gas
is
increased
26


by
more
than
one-half
cent
per
gallon,
a
person
who
has
title
27


to
such
fuel
held
in
storage
for
eventual
sale
is
subject
to
an
28


inventory
tax
based
on
the
gallonage
in
storage
at
the
close
of
29


the
business
day
preceding
the
effective
date
of
the
increase.
30


The
bill
waives
that
requirement
by
stating
that
the
inventory
31


tax
shall
not
be
imposed
as
a
result
of
the
tax
increases
32


provided
in
