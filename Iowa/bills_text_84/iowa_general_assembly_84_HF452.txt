EXPLANATION
26


GENERAL.
This
bill
provides
tax
credits
for
the
promotion
27


of
biodiesel
used
in
the
manufacture
of
motor
fuel
which
28


is
a
blend
of
diesel
fuel
and
biodiesel
(biodiesel
blended
29


fuel).
The
tax
credit
was
enacted
by
the
general
assembly
in
30


2006
as
part
of
H.F.
2754
and
applied
retroactively
to
tax
31


years
beginning
on
and
after
January
1,
2006
(2006
Iowa
Acts,
32


ch.
1142).
Biodiesel
fuel
is
designated
B-xx
where
“xx”
is
33


the
volume
percent
of
biodiesel
(Code
section
214A.2).
For
34


example,
all
biodiesel
blended
fuel
must
be
classified
as
B-1
35

or
higher;
meaning
at
least
1
percent
of
biodiesel
blended
fuel
1


by
volume
must
be
biodiesel.
The
provisions
of
the
bill
are
2


administered
by
the
department
of
revenue.
3


A
retail
dealer
who
sells
and
dispenses
diesel
fuel
from
a
4


motor
fuel
pump
is
eligible
for
a
biodiesel
blended
fuel
tax
5


credit.
The
tax
credit
is
multiplied
by
taking
a
constant
rate
6


of
3
cents
multiplied
by
the
number
of
gallons
of
B-2
or
higher
7


sold
and
dispensed.
The
tax
credit
is
due
to
expire
on
January
8


1,
2012.
9


The
bill
eliminates
an
eligibility
requirement
specifying
10


that
the
retail
dealer
must
sell
and
dispense
50
percent
or
11


more
biodiesel
blended
fuel
during
the
tax
year.
It
increases
12


the
minimum
biodiesel
classification
from
B-2
to
B-10.
It
also
13


eliminates
a
requirement
that
the
tax
credit
be
calculated
14


separately
for
each
motor
fuel
site.
15


House
File
2754
allowed
a
retail
dealer
whose
tax
year
began
16


after
January
1,
2006,
to
claim
the
tax
credit
for
all
of
2006,
17


but
eliminated
the
tax
credit
on
December
31,
2012.
Similarly,
18


the
bill
allows
the
noncalendar
year
taxpayer
to
claim
the
tax
19


credit
for
all
of
2012,
but
ends
the
tax
credit
for
all
retail
20


dealers
on
December
31,
2014.
