For

and
each
fiscal

year
thereafter,
the
bill
appropriates
from
the
general
fund
of
4


the
state
to
the
department
of
revenue
for
deposit
in
the
fund
5


an
amount
equal
to
the
total
amount
appropriated
by
the

assembly
to
the

in
the
previous
fiscal
year.
In
addition,
7


for

after
July
1,
2013,
the
bill
8


appropriates
an

the

however,

19


The
bill
provides
that
each

who
wishes
to

business
property
tax
credit
shall
obtain
the
appropriate
21


forms

22


The

suitable
23


forms
and
instructions
for
such
claims,
and
make
such
forms
24

credit
to
the
county
26


auditor
with
the
assessor’s
recommendation

of
a
claim,
the
assessor
shall
submit
the
reasons
for
the
29


recommendation,
in

board
of
supervisors.
31


The
board
is
required
to
allow
or

10


Upon
the
filing
of
a
claim
and
allowance
of
a
business
11


property
tax
credit,
the
credit
is
allowed
on
the
parcel
or
12


property
unit
for
successive
years
without
further
filing
as
13


long
as
the
parcel
or
property
unit
satisfies
the
requirements
14


for
the
credit.
The
owner
is
required
to
provide
written
15


notice
to
the
assessor
when
the
parcel
or
property
unit
ceases
16


to
qualify
for
the
credit.
The
bill
requires
the
assessor
to
17


maintain
a
permanent
file
of
current
credits
and
also
specifies
18


certain
requirements
for
parcel
or
property
unit
owners,
19


assessors,
and
county
recorders
when
all
or
a
portion
of
such
20


parcels
or
property
units
are
sold,
transferred,
or
ownership
21


otherwise
changes.
22


Under
the
bill,
each
parcel
classified
and
taxed
as
23


commercial
property,
industrial
property,
or
railway
24


property
under
Code
chapter
434,
and
improved
with
permanent
25


construction,
is
eligible
for
a
business
property
tax
credit.
26


A
person
may
claim
and
receive
one
credit
for
each
eligible
27


parcel
unless
the
parcel
is
part
of
a
property
unit.
The
28


bill
defines
“property
unit”
to
mean
contiguous
parcels
29


located
within
the
same
county,
with
the
same
property
tax
30


classification,
each
containing
permanent
improvements,
owned
31


by
the
same
person,
and
operated
by
that
person
for
a
common
32


use
and
purpose.
A
person
may
only
claim
and
receive
one
33


tax
credit
for
each
property
unit.
A
credit
approved
for
a
34


property
unit
is
allocated
to
the
several
parcels

on

bears
to
the

liability
on

for
the

Only
those

comprised
of

or
comprised
of

of
the

to
the

and
the

in
which
each

is
located,
13


shall
be
certified
on
or
before

the

is
required
19


to
calculate,
for
each

year,
an
initial
amount
of
20


actual
value
of
improvements
for
use
in
determining
the
amount
21


of
the
credit
for
each
approved

so
22


as
to
provide
the
maximum
possible

according

and
to
provide
a

following

The

for
each
parcel
or
property
unit
for
which
a
29


claim
for
a
business
property

credit
has
been
approved
is
30


calculated
using
the
lesser
of
the

determined
by
the

then
calculated

the

divided
by

and
then
multiplied
by
the

for

$1,000
of
taxable
value
applicable
to
the
parcel
or

unit
for
the
fiscal
year
for
which
the
credit
is

11


The

specifies
the
procedures
for
the
payment
of
the

amount
of
the
business

to
the
county
