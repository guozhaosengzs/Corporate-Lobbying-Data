b.


As
used
in
this

unless
the
context
otherwise
9


requires:
10


(1)


“Emergency
project”
means
remediation
of
an
11


underutilized
building
that
may
present
a
unique
and
immediate
12


opportunity,
or
a
unique
and
immediate
threat.
13


(2)


“Unique
and
immediate
opportunity”
means
remediation
of
14


an
underutilized
building
is
time-sensitive
and
remediation
is
15


reasonably
expected
to
result
in
economic
growth
for
the
city
16


in
which
the
underutilized
building
is
located.
17


(3)


“Unique
and
immediate
threat”
means
remediation
of
an
18


underutilized
building
may
involve
an
unforeseen
challenge
or


19


problem
that
has
the
potential
to
result
in
a
catastrophic
20


failure
of
the
building’s
integrity
and
structural
system.


21


An
unforeseen
challenge
or
problem
may
include
an
act
of
22


nature
such
as
a
fire,
flood,
or
storm,
or
an
unexpected


23


structural
deficiency
such
as
a
compromised
load-bearing
24


wall.
A
challenge
or
problem
caused
by
deferred
maintenance
25


on
the
underutilized
building
does
not
qualify
as
a
unique
and
26


immediate
threat.
27


EXPLANATION

inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
