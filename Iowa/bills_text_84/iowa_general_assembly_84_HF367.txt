under
Code
chapter
321.
The
all-terrain
vehicle
must
display
13


registration
plates
of
a
size
and
design
to
be
established
by
14


the
state
department
of
transportation.
The
annual
fee
for
15


registration
of
an
all-terrain
vehicle
as
a
motor
vehicle
is
16


$20.
17


A
person
operating
an
all-terrain
vehicle
registered
as
a
18


motor
vehicle
would
be
subject
to
the
same
laws
and
penalties,
19


including
scheduled
fines,
that
apply
to
drivers
of
other
20


motor
vehicles.
A
violation
of
a
provision
of
law
uniquely
21


applicable
to
an
all-terrain
vehicle
registered
as
a
motor
22


vehicle,
not
otherwise
punishable
as
a
motor
vehicle
offense,
23


would
be
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
24


of
$50.
25


Registration
of
an
all-terrain
vehicle
for
the
purpose
of
26


operating
it
on
city
streets
would
not
exempt
the
owner
from
27


the
registration
and
regulation
requirements
administered
by
28


the
department
of
natural
resources.
29


Under
current
law,
counties
and
cities
may
designate
streets
30


under
their
respective
jurisdictions
for
the
operation
of
31


all-terrain
vehicles
registered
by
the
department
of
natural
32


resources.
The
bill
retains
that
authority
for
counties,
but
33


modifies
the
authority
for
cities
by
limiting
it
to
cities
with
34


a
population
of
more
than
10,000.

All
vehicles
subject
to
registration
are
subject
to
a
fee
1


for
new
registration
in
an
amount
equal
to
5
percent
of
the
2


purchase
price,
which
is
due
when
the
owner
registers
the
3


vehicle
for
the
first
time.
The
amount
is
equivalent
to
the
4


amount
of
sales
tax
which
currently
applies
for
all-terrain
5


vehicles.
The
bill
creates
an
exemption
from
the
fee
for
new
6


registration
for
an
all-terrain
vehicle
being
registered
by
7


the
owner
as
a
motor
vehicle
if
the
owner
has
already
paid
the
8


sales
tax
for
the
vehicle.
