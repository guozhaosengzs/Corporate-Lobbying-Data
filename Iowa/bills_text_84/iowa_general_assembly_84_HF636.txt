EXPLANATION
3


This
bill
relates
to
revitalization
areas
by
authorizing
a
4


property
tax
exemption
for
certain
vacant
commercial
property.
5


The
bill
creates
new
Code
section
404.3C
that
establishes
6


a
property
tax
exemption
for
qualified
real
estate
of
a
7


revitalization
area
under
Code
chapter
404
that
is
assessed
8


as
commercial
property,
remained
vacant
for
a
period
of
six
9


consecutive
months,
and
which
meets
one
or
more
specified
10


conditions.
Those
conditions
include
that
the
real
estate
11


regularly
attracts
unauthorized
residential
use,
unlicensed
12


transient
business,
unauthorized
disposal
of
trash,
or
13


unauthorized
parking;
that
the
assessed
value
of
the
real
14


estate
has
declined
during
the
period
of
time
when
the
real
15


estate
has
been
vacant;
and
that
the
real
estate
is
determined
16


to
contain
one
or
more
specified
nuisances.
17


The
bill
establishes
a
15-year
exemption
schedule
that
18


provides
exemptions
for
each
year
ranging
from
not
more
than
80
19


percent
to
not
more
than
20
percent.
The
bill
also
establishes
20


a
five-year
exemption
schedule,
in
lieu
of
the
15-year
21


schedule,
that
provides
a
100
percent
exemption
for
each
of
22


the
five
years.
For
qualified
real
estate
that
includes
23


improvements
meeting
the
LEED
gold
rating
standard,
as
defined
24


in
the
bill,
the
bill
provides
an
alternative
10-year
exemption
25


schedule
that
begins
with
a
100
percent
exemption
for
the
first
26


five
years
and
then
is
reduced
each
year
during
the
last
five
27


years
of
the
exemption.
28


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
