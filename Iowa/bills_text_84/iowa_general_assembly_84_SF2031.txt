EXPLANATION
17


This
bill
relates
to
the
statute
of
repose
period
in
a
18


case
arising
out
of
the
unsafe
or
defective
condition
of
an
19


improvement
to
real
property.
20


The
bill
reduces
the
15-year
statute
of
repose
period
in
a
21


case
arising
out
of
the
unsafe
or
defective
condition
of
an
22


improvement
to
real
property
to
eight
years.
Such
cases
are
23


based
upon
an
injury
to
property
or
an
injury
or
death
of
a
24


person.
25


A
statute
of
repose
period
differs
from
a
statute
of
26


limitations
period
in
that
a
statute
of
repose
period
27


establishes
a
time
period
after
which
a
lawsuit
based
upon
28


negligence
in
an
improvement
to
real
property
cannot
be
filed
29


regardless
of
whether
an
injury
to
a
person
or
to
property
has
30


occurred.
A
statute
of
limitations
period
begins
at
the
date
31


of
the
injury
or
upon
discovery
of
the
deficiency.
32


The
bill
applies
to
all
actions
filed
on
or
after
the
33


effective
date
of
the
bill.
