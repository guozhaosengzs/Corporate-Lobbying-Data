15


EXPLANATION
16


This
bill
provides
employee
leave
by
providing
for
time
off
17


and
vacation
leave.
18


The
bill
relates
to
payments
for
accrued
vacation
time
and
19


for
accrued
paid
time
off
for
all
employees
who
are
terminated
20


or
suspended.
21


Current
law
requires
an
employer
to
pay
accrued
vacation
pay
22


to
a
terminated
or
suspended
employee
only
if
the
employer
has
23


a
policy,
procedure,
or
contract
that
requires
the
employer
to
24


do
so.
25


The
bill
defines
“paid
time
off”
as
a
benefit
allowing
an
26


employee
to
take
time
off
from
work
with
pay
without
regard
to
27


the
reason
the
employee
chooses
to
take
the
time
off.
“Paid
28


time
off”
is
also
added
to
the
definition
of
“wages”.
29


The
bill
provides
that
if
an
employee
is
suspended
or
30


terminated
upon
request
the
employer
must
pay
all
wages,
now
31


including
paid
time
off,
earned
by
the
next
regular
payday.
32


The
bill
provides
an
exception
for
when
an
employee
who
earned
33


paid
time
off
while
employed
but
not
vacation,
the
employer
34


may
reduce
the
pay
for
the
accrued
paid
time
off
by
one-third.

Finally,
there
is
an
exception
for
when
an
employee
earned
both
1


vacation
and
paid
time
off
while
employed,
the
employer
is
not
2


required
to
make
payment
for
the
paid
time
off.
3


An
employer
shall
not
adopt
a
policy
or
practice
to
deny
4


payment
for
accrued
vacation
or
accrued
paid
time
off
upon
the
5


suspension
or
termination
of
an
employee
unless
the
employee’s
6


employment
ended
due
to
misconduct.
Misconduct
is
not
defined
7


in
statute
but
is
defined
in
the
department
of
workforce
8


development’s
administrative
rules.
9


The
bill
provides
a
formula
to
calculate
the
payment
for
an
10


employee’s
accrued
paid
time
off
or
vacation
if
the
employee
is
11


suspended
or
terminated.
Except
as
otherwise
provided
by
the
12


formula,
the
amount
of
pay
owed
to
an
employee
is
the
amount
of
13


pay
equal
to
the
accrued
vacation
or
paid
time
off
as
if
the
14


employee
began
taking
the
vacation
or
paid
time
off
the
day
the
15


suspension
or
termination
took
place.
This
formula
substitutes
16


the
pro
rata
policy
for
how
accrued
vacation
is
currently
paid
17


out
if
an
employee’s
policy
or
practice
required
it.
18


The
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
The
bill
is
made
19


applicable
only
to
the
suspension
or
termination
of
an
20


employee’s
employment
that
occurs
on
or
after
that
date.
