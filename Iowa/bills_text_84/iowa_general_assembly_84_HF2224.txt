However,

as

of
the

shall
file
their

following
the
8

and
nonprofit
corporations
subject
9


to
the
unrelated

imposed
by

subsection

,

returns
on
or
before
11


the
fifteenth
day
of
the
fifth
month
following
the
close

If,
under
the

Code,
a
13


corporation
is
required
to
file
a
return
covering
a
tax
period
14


of
less
than
twelve
months,
the
state
return
shall
be
for
the
15


same
period
and
is
due
forty-five

the
due
date
of

distributed
21


throughout
the
state
and
to
be
furnished
upon
application,
22


but
failure
to
receive
or
secure
the
form
does
not
relieve
23


the
taxpayer
from
the
obligation
of
making
a
return
that
is
24


required.
The
department
may
as
far
as
