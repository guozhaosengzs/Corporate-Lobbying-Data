NEW
SECTION
.
8.71
Ongoing
program
review
——
1


repeal
dates.

1.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
a
regular
review
of
3


the
programs
and
projects
administered
by
state
government
is
4


necessary
to
determine
whether
each
program
and
project
is
5


effectively
and
efficiently
meeting
the
needs
for
which
created
6


and
whether
the
needs
remain
applicable.
The
general
assembly
7


further
finds
that
a
regular,
systematic
review
process
can
8


identify
the
programs
and
projects
that
are
no
longer
relevant
9


or
functioning
at
a
desirable
level
and
can
eliminate
or
10


reorganize
those
programs
and
projects
so
that
state
resources
11


can
be
used
most
effectively
or
diverted
to
other
priorities.

The

Assembly,

15


Session,
providing
a
staggered
schedule
for
establishing
an
16


automatic
repeal
date
for
each
program
or
project
administered
17


by
a
department
of
state
government
over
the
succeeding
18


five-year
period.
The
committees
on
state
government
shall
19


consult
with
the
office
of
the
governor
and
the
department
20


of
management
in
formulating
the
staggered
schedule
and
the
21

shall
cooperate
in
providing
necessary
22


information
requested
by
either

The

date

provisions
shall
be

in
a
