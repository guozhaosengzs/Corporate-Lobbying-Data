EXPLANATION

GENERALLY.
This
bill
relates
to
motor
fuel
regulated
by
the
13


department
of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship
(DALS)
pursuant
14


to
Code
chapter
214A
and
classified
according
to
the
percentage
15


of
biofuel
blended
into
the
motor
fuel
(e.g.,
E-10
means
a
16


gallon
of
gasoline
containing
10
percent
ethanol
and
B-5
means
17


a
gallon
of
diesel
fuel
containing
5
percent
biodiesel).
Both
18


ethanol
blended
gasoline
and
biodiesel
blended
fuel
are
subject
19


to
promotional
programs
and
tax
incentives.
20


GENERAL
——
REGULATION
OF
MOTOR
FUEL.
The
bill
amends
21


several
provisions
in
Code
chapter
214A,
which
regulates
the
22


sale
of
motor
fuel
by
DALS.
The
bill
establishes
a
standard
23


for
biodiesel
blended
fuel
based
on
A.S.T.M.
international
24


specifications.
It
also
rewrites
a
provision
that
requires
25


that
a
motor
fuel
pump
be
affixed
with
a
decal
(label)
26


informing
the
traveling
public
whether
it
is
dispensing
a
motor
27


fuel
containing
ethanol
or
biodiesel.
It
retains
the
label
28


requirement
for
a
motor
fuel
pump
dispensing
E-85
gasoline
29


for
flexible
fuel
vehicles
or
biodiesel
blended
fuel
for
30


diesel-powered
motor
vehicles,
removes
a
provision
requiring
a
31


label
for
a
motor
fuel
pump
dispensing
other
types
of
ethanol
32


blended
fuel
(standard
ethanol
blended
gasoline),
and
requires
33


a
label
for
a
motor
fuel
pump
dispensing
gasoline
without
an
34


ethanol
component
(nonblended
gasoline).

LIMITING
LIABILITY
OF
RETAIL
DEALERS.
The
bill
amends
1


Code
chapter
214A,
which
provides
for
motor
fuel,
including
2


gasoline
or
ethanol
blended
gasoline,
E-85
gasoline,
diesel
3


fuel,
and
biodiesel
fuel.
The
bill
provides
that
a
retail
4


dealer
is
not
liable
for
damages
caused
to
a
motor
by
the
use
5


of
an
incompatible
motor
fuel
(e.g.,
the
use
of
E-85
gasoline
6


in
a
conventional
gasoline-powered
motor).
The
bar
against
7


liability
depends
upon
the
satisfaction
of
certain
conditions:
8


(1)
the
motor
fuel
must
meet
legal
specifications,
(2)
the
9


retail
dealer
cannot
have
selected
it
for
use
in
the
motor,
and
10


(3)
the
dispensing
pump
must
be
correctly
labeled.
11


INFRASTRUCTURE.
The
bill
suspends
the
operation
of
two
12


current
programs
providing
incentives
for
the
installation
of
13


renewable
fuel
infrastructure.
The
programs
are
supported
from
14


moneys
deposited
in
the
renewable
fuel
infrastructure
fund.
15


The
bill
provides
that
the
department
of
economic
development
16


and
the
renewable
fuel
infrastructure
board
must
use
all
17


available
moneys
deposited
in
the
fund
to
award
financial
18


incentives
to
retail
dealers
participating
in
a
project
to
19


install
infrastructure
associated
with
dispensing
renewable
20


fuel
from
motor
fuel
blender
pumps.
The
board
must
report
to
21


the
general
assembly
regarding
the
project.
The
project
is
22


eliminated
on
July
1,
2014.
23


The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
which
provides
that
moneys
24


in
the
fund
revert
at
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
beginning
July
25


1,
2011.
26


This
division
of
the
bill
takes
effect
upon
enactment.
27


ETHANOL
BLENDED
GASOLINE
TAX
CREDIT
AND
REPORTING.
The
bill
28


amends
the
ethanol
promotion
tax
credit
which
is
calculated
29


separately
for
each
retail
motor
fuel
site
from
which
the
30


retail
dealer
sells
and
dispenses
ethanol
blended
gasoline
31


(Code
sections
422.11N
and
422.33,
subsection
11A).
The
tax
32


credit
rate
depends
upon
the
number
of
gallons
of
ethanol
33


blended
gasoline
and
biodiesel
blended
fuel
that
a
retail
34


dealer
sold
throughout
a
calendar
year
(referred
to
as
a
35


-12-


LSB
2723SV
(1)
84


da/nh
12/
14



S.F.
476


determination
period).
The
amount
of
the
tax
credit
depends
1


upon
whether
the
retail
dealer
met
that
biofuel
threshold.
2


This
bill
renames
the
tax
credit
as
the
E-15
promotion
tax
3


credit,
and
provides
that
the
tax
credit
applies
only
to
those
4


gallons
of
ethanol
that
are
part
of
ethanol
blended
gasoline
5


designated
as
E-15
or
higher.
It
also
allows
a
retail
dealer
6


filing
a
tax
return
on
a
noncalendar
year
basis
to
claim
the
7


tax
credit.
The
tax
credit
is
eliminated
on
January
1,
2021.
8


The
bill
also
amends
reporting
requirements
by
retail
9


dealers
and
the
department
of
revenue.
A
retail
dealer’s
10


report
calculates
the
total
motor
fuel
gallonage,
and
further
11


divides
that
number
based
on
a
number
of
classifications
12


depending
upon
the
type
of
motor
fuel
sold,
including
ethanol
13


blended
gasoline
gallonage.
The
department
then
calculates
14


the
aggregate
total
for
the
motor
fuel
gallonage
including
by
15


classification
for
the
determination
period.
The
bill
revises
16


the
reporting
classifications
for
ethanol
blended
gasoline,
17


by
including
subclassifications
for
E-9
and
E-10,
E-11
to
18


E-15,
and
E-16
to
E-85.
It
provides
that
the
department
may
19


establish
additional
subclassifications.
20


This
division
of
the
bill
is
effective
on
January
1,
2012,
21


and
tax
credit
provisions
are
applicable
to
the
tax
years
22


beginning
on
or
after
that
date.
23


EXCISE
TAXES
IMPOSED
UPON
BIODIESEL
FUEL.
The
bill
amends
24


provisions
in
Code
chapter
452A
which
relate
to
an
excise
tax
25


imposed
upon
biodiesel
fuel.
Generally,
an
excise
tax
is
26


imposed
on
each
gallon
of
motor
fuel,
including
biodiesel
fuel
27


(Code
section
452A.3)
based
on
a
gross
volume
basis
without
28


adjustment
(Code
section
452A.86).
The
bill
does
not
directly
29


change
the
excise
tax
imposed
on
biodiesel
fuel,
but
changes
30


how
the
gallonage
is
calculated
at
the
meter,
by
requiring
that
31


the
excise
tax
be
