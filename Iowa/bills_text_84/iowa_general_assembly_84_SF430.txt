of

Require
the
respondent
to
pay
damages
as
provided
for


in
section
21.6
or
22.10,
whichever
is
applicable,
to
the


extent
that
provision
would
make
such
damages
payable
if
the


complainant
had
sought
to
enforce
a
violation
in
court
instead


of
through
the
board.


(2)
Void
any
action
taken
in
violation
of
chapter
21
if
a


court
would
be
authorized
to
do
so
in
similar
circumstances


pursuant
to
section

(3)
Require
the
respondent
to
take
any

the
authority
to
remove
a
person


from

a
violation
of
chapter

The


board
may
file
an
action
under
chapter
21
or

remove
a


person
from
office
for
violations
that
would
subject
a
person


to
removal
under
those
chapters.


d.
A
final
board
order
resulting
from
such
proceedings
may


be
enforced
by
the
board
in
court
and
is
subject
to
judicial


review

proceeding.

respondent
may
defend
against
a
proceeding
before
the


board
charging
a
violation
of
chapter
21
or
22
on
the
ground


that
if
such
a
violation
occurred
it
was
only
harmless
error
or


that
clear
and
convincing
evidence
demonstrated
that
grounds


existed
to
justify
a

to
issue
an
injunction
against


disclosure
pursuant
to
section
22.8.
