EXPLANATION
20


This
bill
provides
for
the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
21


on
highways,
subject
to
certain
restrictions.
22


Under
current
law,
all-terrain
vehicles
are
registered
23


by
the
department
of
natural
resources
for
recreational
use
24


on
public
land
or
ice.
In
general,
registered
all-terrain
25


vehicles
may
not
be
used
on
roadways
or
within
a
highway
26


right-of-way,
but
a
city
or
county
has
the
authority
to
27


allow
all-terrain
vehicles
on
local
roads
under
specified
28


circumstances.
All-terrain
vehicles
which
are
used
for
29


agricultural
purposes
are
exempt
from
registration
requirements
30


and
are
permitted
on
highways
between
the
hours
of
sunrise
31


and
sunset
if
the
operation
is
incidental
to
the
vehicle’s
32


use
for
agricultural
purposes,
including
stopping
for
fuel
33


or
for
food
or
a
beverage
for
the
operator.
In
addition,
34


all-terrain
vehicles
are
permitted
on
a
highway
when
operated

H.F.
2017


for
purposes
of
land
surveying
by
a
licensed
engineer
or
land
1


surveyor;
by
an
employee
or
agent
of
a
political
subdivision
2


or
public
utility
for
purposes
of
construction
or
maintenance
3


adjacent
to
the
highway;
by
an
employee
or
agent
of
a
public
4


agency
providing
emergency
rescue
or
services;
and
for
mowing,
5


installing
signs,
or
providing
maintenance
on
a
designated
6


snowmobile
trail
or
all-terrain
vehicle
riding
trail.
7


The
bill
allows
any
person
with
a
valid
driver’s
license
8


to
operate
an
all-terrain
vehicle
on
a
noninterstate
highway
9


between
the
hours
of
sunrise
and
sunset.
The
daytime
10


restriction
does
not
apply
to
highway
use
which
is
currently
11


permitted
for
limited
purposes.
Current
restrictions
which
12


apply
to
all-terrain
vehicles
used
for
agricultural
purposes
13


and
considered
implements
of
husbandry
are
not
changed
under
14


the
bill.
15


Pursuant
to
current
law,
a
person
who
operates
an
16


all-terrain
vehicle
on
a
highway
must
have
a
valid
driver’s
17


license,
and
the
vehicle
must
be
operated
at
speeds
of
35
18


miles
per
hour
or
less.
Because
an
all-terrain
vehicle
is
19


principally
designed
for
use
off
the
highway,
and
because
20


of
the
35
mile
per
hour
speed
restriction,
an
all-terrain
21


vehicle
is
required
to
display
a
reflective
device
visible
22


from
the
rear
when
operated
on
a
highway,
pursuant
to
current
23


requirements
for
slow
vehicles.
A
violation
of
restrictions
on
24


the
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
on
a
highway
is
a
simple
25


misdemeanor,
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$50.
Failure
to
26


display
a
reflective
device
is
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
27


by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$30.
28


The
bill
provides
that
all-terrain
vehicles
which
are
used
29


only
on
highways,
and
not
on
public
lands,
are
not
subject
to
30


registration
by
the
department
of
natural
resources.
The
bill
31


strikes
current
provisions
authorizing
cities
and
counties
to
32


allow
operation
of
all-terrain
vehicles
on
local
roads.
