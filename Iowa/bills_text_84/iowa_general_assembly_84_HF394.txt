EXPLANATION
16


BACKGROUND.
This
bill
amends
provisions
affecting
persons
17


who
operate
dairy
farms,
including
provisions
for
the
18


processing
of
milk
and
the
manufacture
of
milk
products,
and
19


dairy
products
on
such
farms.
The
provisions
are
administered
20


and
enforced
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
21


stewardship.
22


Generally,
statutory
provisions
and
departmental
rules
23


regulating
milk
are
based
on
model
legislation
referred
to
24


as
the
“Grade
‘A’
Pasteurized
Milk
Ordinance”
(Code
section
25


192.101A).
The
“Grade
‘A’
Pasteurized
Milk
Ordinance”
defines
26


a
milk
product
as
including
cream,
sour
cream,
dry
milk,
27


concentrated
milk,
eggnog,
buttermilk,
and
yogurt.
All
food
28


offered
or
exposed
for
sale
must
be
labeled
(Code
section
29


191.1).
This
includes
labeling
the
milk
or
milk
product
as
30


“raw”
(Code
section
191.2(5)(e)).
All
milk
must
be
sold
on
31


the
basis
of
grade
(Code
section
194.10)
and
only
grade
“A”
32


pasteurized
milk
and
milk
products
can
be
sold
to
the
final
33


consumer
(Code
section
192.103).
Grade
“B”
milk
may
be
sold
34


for
manufacturing
purposes
(21
IAC
68.2).

dairy
farms

selling
grade
“A”
or
grade
“B”
milk
must
be
issued
a
permit
1


by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship
(21
IAC
2


68.2).
3


The
bill
provides
that
these
regulatory
provisions
do
not
4


apply
to
a
person
who
operates
a
dairy
farm.
The
person
may
5


produce
milk
and
dispose
of
it
or
sell
it
to
an
individual
on
6


a
retail
basis.
The
operator
may
also
deliver
the
milk
to
a
7


location
specified
by
the
individual.
The
bill
also
provides
8


that
the
regulatory
provisions
do
not
apply
to
the
operator
of
9


a
dairy
farm
who
manufactures
a
milk
product
or
dairy
product,
10


who
may
dispose
of
the
product
or
sell
it
in
the
same
manner
as
11


milk.
A
milk
product
is
defined
by
the
“Grade
‘A’
Pasteurized
12


Milk
Ordinance”
and
includes
cream
or
yogurt.
A
dairy
product
13


includes
a
product
other
than
a
milk
product
whose
principal
14


ingredient
is
milk
(e.g.,
ice
cream).
15


A
person
who
violates
the
bill’s
provisions
is
guilty
of
a
16


simple
misdemeanor
(Code
section
189.21).
A
simple
misdemeanor
17


is
punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
30
days
or
a
fine
18


of
at
least
$65
but
not
more
than
$625
or
by
both.
