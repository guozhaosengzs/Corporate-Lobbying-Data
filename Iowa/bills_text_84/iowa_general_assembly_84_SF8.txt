1.
A

a
3


motor
by
the
use
of
incompatible
motor
fuel
dispensed
at
the
4


retail
dealer’s
retail

fuel
site,
if
all
of
the
following
5


applies:

for
a

For

EXPLANATION
18


This
bill
amends
Code
chapter
214A,
which
provides
for
motor
19


fuel,
including
gasoline
or
ethanol
blended
gasoline,
E-85
20


gasoline,
diesel
fuel,
and
biodiesel
fuel.
The
bill
provides
21


that
a
retail
dealer
is
not
liable
for
damages
caused
to
a
22


motor
by
the
use
of
an
incompatible
motor
fuel
(e.g.,
the
use
23


of
E-85
gasoline
in
a
conventional
gasoline-powered
motor).
24


The
bar
against
liability
depends
upon
the
satisfaction
25


of
certain
conditions:
(1)
the
motor
fuel
must
meet
legal
26


specifications,
(2)
the
retail
dealer
cannot
have
selected
27


it
for
use
in
the
motor,
and
(3)
the
dispensing
pump
must
be
28


correctly
labeled.
