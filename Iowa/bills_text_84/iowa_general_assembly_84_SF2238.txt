10


Code
section
411.8(1)(f),
concerning
the
contribution
rate
11


payable
by
members
of
the
system,
is
amended
to
provide
that
12


members
whose
membership
in
the
system
first
commenced
on
13


or
after
July
1,
2012,
shall
pay
10.4

14


compensation
to
the
system.
All
other

of
the
system
15


shall
continue

percent.
Current
law
that

16


for
an
increase

the
employee

under
certain
17


circumstances
remains
unchanged
and
is

was
repealed
and
replaced
with
a
set
state
