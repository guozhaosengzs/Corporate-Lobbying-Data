EXPLANATION
8


Under
current
law,
when
the
driver
of
a
motor
vehicle
is
9


approaching
a
stationary
authorized
emergency
vehicle
that
is
10


displaying
flashing
yellow,
amber,
white,
red,
or
red
and
blue
11


lights,
or
a
stationary
towing
or
recovery
vehicle,
utility
12


maintenance
vehicle,
municipal
maintenance
vehicle,
or
highway
13


maintenance
vehicle
that
is
displaying
flashing
yellow,
amber,
14


or
red
lights,
the
driver
is
required
to
move
into
a
lane
not
15


adjacent
to
the
stationary
vehicle
if
possible
in
the
existing
16


safety
and
traffic
conditions.
If
changing
lanes
would
be
17


impossible,
unlawful,
or
unsafe,
the
driver
is
required
to
18


reduce
the
speed
of
the
motor
vehicle
to
a
reasonable
and
19


proper
speed
for
the
existing
road
and
traffic
conditions,
20


which
speed
shall
be
less
than
the
posted
speed
limit,
and
be
21


prepared
to
stop.
This
bill
amends
the
provision
relating
to
22


reduced
speed
by
specifying
that
if
making
a
lane
change
would
23


be
impossible,
prohibited
by
law,
or
unsafe,
the
driver
shall
24


reduce
the
speed
of
the
motor
vehicle
to
a
speed
that
is
both
25


less
than
the
posted
speed
limit
and
reasonable
and
proper
for
26


the
existing
road
and
traffic
conditions
and
the
driver
shall
27


be
prepared
to
stop.
28


Under
current
law,
a
violation
of
the
requirements
to
move
29


over
or
slow
down
when
approaching
certain
stationary
vehicles
30


is
a
simple
misdemeanor
punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$100.
31


However,
if
the
violation
causes
a
serious
personal
injury,
32


a
court
could
impose
an
additional
fine
of
$500
or
suspend
33


the
person’s
driver’s
license
for
not
more
than
90
days,
or
34


both.
If
the
violation
causes
a
death,
a
court
could
impose
35

S.F.

an
additional
fine
of
$1,000
or
suspend
the
person’s
driver’s
1


license
for
not
more
than
180
days,
or
both.
2


Under
the
bill,
a
violation
is
still
a
simple
misdemeanor
3


punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$100,
but
the
bill
4


establishes
a
new
penalty
for
violations
causing
damage
to
5


property
and
revises
the
penalties
for
violations
causing
6


injury
or
death
of
another
person.
Under
the
bill,
if
the
7


violation
causes
damage
to
the
property
of
another
person
but
8


does
not
result
in
bodily
injury
to
or
death
of
another
person,
9


the
person’s
driver’s
license
or
operating
privileges
are
10


suspended
for
not
less
than
90
days
and
not
more
than
one
year.
11


If
the
violation
causes
bodily
injury
to
another
person,
the
12


person’s
driver’s
license
or
operating
privileges
are
suspended
13


for
not
less
than
180
days
and
not
more
than
one
year.
If
14


the
violation
causes
death,
the
person’s
driver’s
license
or
15


operating
privileges
are
suspended
for
one
year.
The
periods
16


of
suspension
are
in
addition
to
any
other
penalties
applicable
17


under
law.
18


The
bill
requires
the
department
of
transportation
and
the
19


department
of
public
safety
to
establish
educational
programs
20


to
promote
public
awareness
and
compliance
with
requirements
21


for
motorists
approaching
certain
stationary
vehicles.
