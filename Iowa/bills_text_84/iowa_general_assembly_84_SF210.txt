Act
in

to
address
the

for

24


The
bill
specifies
a
procedure
for
the
state’s
retention
of
a
25


private
attorney
on
a
contingency
fee
basis.
The
bill
requires
26


the
attorney
general
to
analyze
certain
factors
and
make
a
27


written
determination
that
the
contingency
fee
representation
28


will
be
both
cost-effective
and
in
the
public
interest
prior

to
entering
into

5


that

All
contingency

6


must
include
certain
standard
provisions
to
help
assure
7


that
government
attorneys
retain
absolute
control
over
the
8


litigation.
The
bill
requires
the
contingency
fee
contract,
9


payments
made
under
the
contract,
and
the
attorney
general’s
10


written
determination
about
the
need
for
contingency
fee
11


representation
to
be

the
attorney
general’s
website.
12


Other
records
relating
to
the
contract
are
subject
to
Code
13


chapter
22
(Iowa’s
open
records
law).
The
contracted
private
14


attorneys
and
paralegals
are
required
to
maintain
detailed
15


contemporaneous
time
records
for
presentation
to
the
attorney
16


general
upon
request.
The
attorney
general
is
required
to
17


submit
an
annual
report
to
the
secretary
of
the
senate
and
the
18


chief
clerk
of
the
house
of
representatives
that
describes
the
19


state’s
retention
of
private
attorneys
on
a
contingency
fee
20


basis
in
the
preceding
calendar
year.
21


The
bill
does
not
expand
the
state’s
authority
to
enter
into
22


contracts
where
no
such
authority
previously
existed.
23


The
bill
provides
that
this
new
Code
chapter
does
not
apply
24


to
legal
services
contracts
under
Code
chapter
13B
relating
to
25


public
defenders.
26


The
bill
amends
Code
section
13.7,
the
current
Code
section
27


relating
to
the
retention
of
private
counsel
by
executive
28


branch
departments
and
by
the
attorney
general,
to
specify
that
29


the
procedures
in
new
Code
chapter
23B
apply.
