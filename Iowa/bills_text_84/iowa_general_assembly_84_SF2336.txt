increasing
parental
knowledge
of
child
development,
and


increasing
family
functioning
and
problem
solving
skills.
A


family
support
program
may
be
used
as
an
early
intervention


strategy
to
improve
birth
outcomes,
parental
knowledge,
family


economic
success,
the
home
learning
environment,
family
and


child
involvement
with
others,
and
coordination
with
other


community
resources.
A
family
support
program
may
have
a


specific
focus
on
preventing
child
maltreatment
or
ensuring


children
are
safe,
healthy,
and
ready
to
succeed
in
school.


(c)
“Promising
program”
means
a
program
that
meets
all
of


the
following

clear,
consistent
family


support
model
that
has
been
in
existence
for
at
least
three


years.


(ii)
The
program
is
grounded
in
relevant
empirically-based


knowledge.


(iii)
The
program
is
linked
to
program-determined
outcomes.


(iv)
The
program
is
associated
with
a
national
or
state


organization
that
either
has
comprehensive
program
standards


that
ensure
high-quality
service
delivery
and
continuous


program
quality
improvement
or
the
program
model
has


demonstrated
through
the
program’s
benchmark
outcomes
that
the


program
has
achieved
significant
positive
outcomes
equivalent


to
those
achieved
by
program
models
with
published
significant


and
sustained
results
in
a
peer-reviewed
journal.


(v)
The
program
has
been
awarded
the
Iowa
family
support


credential
and
has
been
reviewed
onsite
at
least
every
five


years
to
ensure
the
program’s
adherence
to
the
Iowa
family


support
standards
approved
by
the
early
childhood
Iowa


state
board
created
in
section
256I.3
or
a
comparable
set
of


standards.
The
onsite
review
is
completed

independent


review
team
that
is
not
associated

administering
the
