Modifications

which
provide
19


that

attending
such

are
ineligible
for
state
20


student
financial
aid
programs,
authorize
the
commission
21


to

agency.
5


The
bill
authorizes
the
commission
to
require
additional

information
from
a
school
if
the
additional
information

deemed
necessary
in

to

registered
school’s

9


reference
that
it
is
registered
with
the
commission
and
shall
10


include
the
commission’s
contact
information
for
students
who
11


wish
to
register
a

about
the
school.
12


The
commission
is
also
authorized
to
grant
a
provisional
13


registration,
the
duration
of
which
is
to
be
determined
by
the
14


commission,
to
a
school
that
is
not
accredited
by
an
agency
or
15


organization
recognized
by
the
U.S.
department
of
education.
16


During
the
provisional
registration
period,
the
school
must
17


submit
to
the
commission,
at
six-month
intervals,
documentation
18


regarding
its
progress
toward

renew
the
provisional
registration
at
its
20


discretion
based
on
documentation
that
the
school
is

schools
required

state
24


aid
is
or
may
be
available
to
students
attending
the
school.
25


The
bill
makes
changes
to
the
Code
chapter’s
definitions
of
26


“degree”,
“presence”,
and
“school”
and
adds
definitions
for
