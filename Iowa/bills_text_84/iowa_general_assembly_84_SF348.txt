information
exchange
into
the
new
Iowa
health
benefit
exchange
1


consistent
with
state
and
federal
law.
The
bill
specifies
the
2


powers
and
duties
of
the
exchange
to
carry
out
the
intent
of
3


the
chapter
consistent
with
the
PPACA
and
state
law.
4


The
exchange
is
given
parameters
for
certifying
health
5


benefit
plans
as
qualified
health
benefit
plans.
Under
the
6


PPACA,
only
qualified
health
benefit
plans
can
be
sold
through
7


the
exchange
and
a
health
benefit
plan
must
be
certified
as
8


meeting
certain
minimum
standards
specified
in
the
PPACA
and
9


in
this
bill
to
be
certified
as
a
qualified
health
benefit
10


plan.
Also,
a
health
carrier
must
meet
certain
standards
in
11


order
to
have
its
plans
certified
so
that
the
plans
can
be
12


offered
through
the
exchange.
Licensed
insurance
producers
13


are
allowed
to
assist
individuals
and
small

of

exchange
is
authorized

17


more

concerning
the

private
grants
and
from
assessment

charged
to
health

to
federal
law,
no
state
23

of
the
assessment
25


for
each
health
carrier
to
pay
the
exchange
losses
and
expenses
26


is
to
be
shared
on
an
equitable
and
proportionate
basis
based
27


on
the
health
carrier’s
respective
share
of
total
health

insurance
premiums
or
payments
for
subscriber
contracts
