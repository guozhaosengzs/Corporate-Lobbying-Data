of

18


authorizes

The

as
a
bank
holding
company
25


that
is
a
mutual
corporation
or
that
owns
or
controls
a
mutual
26


corporation.
The
division
authorizes
the
superintendent
of
27


banking
to
adopt
rules
to
ensure
that
a
state
bank
incorporated
28


as
a
mutual
corporation
is
operating
in
a
safe
and
sound
manner
29


and
is
subject
to
the
superintendent’s
authority
in
the
same
30


manner
as
a
state
bank
incorporated
as
a
stock
corporation,
31


and
makes
several
modifications
to
existing
provisions
in
Code
32


chapter
524
to
differentiate
between
stock
corporations
and
33


mutual
corporations.
34


The
division
provides
that
a
mutual
corporation,
a
mutual
35

holding
company,
a
federal
mutual
association,
or
a
federal
1


mutual
holding
company
may
convert

a
stock
corporation
2


that
is

bank
or
a

mutual
bank
holding

upon

pursuant
to
specified
federal
regulations
to
convert
to
a
12


mutual
bank
holding
company.
The
division
also
authorizes
a
13


mutual
corporation
to
reorganize
as
a
mutual
holding
company
as
14


prescribed
in
specified
federal
regulations,
which
would
then
15


be
regarded
as

chapter
524.
The
division
states
that

Act,

or
a
rule
of
the
superintendent,
21


the
provisions
of

or

shall
control.

The
division
authorizes

Code
chapter

pertaining

mutual
bank
holding
24


companies
and

is

federal
home
loan
bank’s
acquired
member
assets
program
as
2


provided
for
in
12
C.F.R.
pt.
955.
The
division
states
that
3


the
superintendent
may,
in
the
superintendent’s
discretion,
by
4


regulation
or
order,
exempt
transactions
or
relationships
from
5


the
requirements
of
that
Code
section
if
the
superintendent
6


finds
such
exemptions
to
be
in
the
public
interest
and
7


consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
Code
section.
The
division
8


provides
that
a
state
bank
may
request
an
exemption
from
the
9


requirements
of
Code
section
524.1102
by
submitting
a
written
10


request
to
the
superintendent
including
a
detailed
description
11


of
the
transaction
or
relationship
for
which
the
state
bank
12


seeks
the
exemption,
a
statement
of
the
reasons
for
exemption
13


of
the
transaction
or
relationship,
and
an
explanation
of
how
14


the
exemption
would
be
in
the
public
interest
and
consistent
15


with
the
purposes
of
the
Code
section.
16


The
division
also
modifies
provisions
relating
to
the
17


involuntary
dissolution
of
a
state
bank.
The
division
18


eliminates
the
option
of
the
superintendent
applying
to
19


the
district
court
for
the
county
in
which
the
state
bank
20


is
located
for
appointment
as
receiver
for
the
state
bank,
21


providing
instead
that
the
superintendent
shall
tender
the
22


receivership
to
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation.
The
23


division
states
that
thereafter
the
affairs
of
the
state
bank
24


shall
be
governed
by
specified
sections
of
Code
chapter
524,
25


and
by
the
provisions
of
federal
law,
and
shall
be
subject
26


to
federal
court
jurisdiction.
The
division
specifies
that
27


federal
law
shall
govern
in
the
event
of
a
conflict
between
28


state
and
federal
law
provisions.
29


The
division
provides
that
under
the
receivership,
the
30


rights
of
depositors
and
other
creditors
of
the
insured
state
31


bank
shall
be
determined
in
accordance
with
Iowa
law,
and
that
32


the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
as
receiver
shall
33


possess
all
the
powers,
rights,
and
privileges
provided
under
34


Code
section
524.1311,
except
insofar
as

Code
section
35


-63-

H.F.

may
be
in
conflict
with
the
laws
of
the
United
States.
The
1


division
also
provides
that
if
the
federal
deposit
insurance
2


corporation
pays
or
makes
available
for
payment
the
insured
3


deposit
liabilities
of
an
insured
state
bank,
the
federal
4


deposit
insurance
corporation
shall
be
subrogated
by
operation
5


of
law
to
all
rights
against
such
insured
state
bank
of
6


the
owners
of
such
deposits
in
the
same
manner
and
to
the
7


same
extent
as
subrogation
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
8


corporation
is
provided
for
in
applicable
federal
law
in
the
9


case
of
a
national
bank.
These
provisions
are
currently
10


contained
in
Code
section
524.1313,
which
applied
if
the
11


superintendent
had
optionally
designated
the
federal
deposit
12


insurance
corporation
as
receiver,
rather
than
as
mandated
by
13


the
division.
Accordingly,
that
Code
section
is
repealed.
14


The
division
makes
conforming
changes
relating
to
the
15


federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
being
appointed
as
16


receiver
in
Code
section
524.1311
relating
to
receivership
17


procedures.
The
division
deletes
a
provision
that
all
expenses
18


of
the
receivership
and
dissolution
shall
be
fixed
by
the
19


superintendent,
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
district
court,
20


and
shall
be
paid
out
of
the
assets
of
the
state
bank.
The
21


division
provides
that
after
the
involuntary
dissolution,
the
22


superintendent
shall
file
notice
of
the
dissolution
with
the
23


secretary
of
state
and
the
county
recorder
of
the
county
in
24


which
the
state
bank
is
located,
that
no
fee
shall
be
charged
25


by
the
secretary
of
state
or
the
county
recorder
for
the
filing
26


or
recording,
and
that
the
corporate
existence
of
the
state
27


bank
shall
cease
upon
filing
of
the
notice
of
dissolution
28


with
the
secretary
of
state.
The
division
deletes
provisions
29


contained
in
Code
section
524.1311
which
had
related
to
filing
30


of
a
final
report
by
the
superintendent
and
filing
of
a
decree
31


of
dissolution
by
the
district
court.
32


The
division
additionally
provides,
with
respect
to
33


examinations
of
the
books,
accounts,
records,
and
files
34


of
a
mortgage
banker
licensee,
that

by
the

of

The
bill
states
that
the
title

division
may
6


use
this
information
to
satisfy
its
reinsurance
requirements
7


and
may
provide
the
information
to

to
the
8


extent
necessary
to

provided
9


the

The
bill
directs
the

division
to

Division
III
of
the
bill
16


repeals
Code
chapter

state
savings
and
loan
17


associations.
The
division
makes
conforming
changes
consistent
18


with
the
repeal
of
the
Code
chapter.
The
bill
additionally
19


deletes
references
to
building
and
loan
associations
and,
where
20


appropriate,
to
savings
banks.
21

not
