EXPLANATION
1


GENERAL.
This
bill
amends
provisions
relating
to
the
2


regulation
of
infectious
or
contagious
diseases
affecting
3


animals,
including
swine,
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
4


land
stewardship
(Code
chapter
163).
Generally,
the
department
5


is
authorized
to
provide
for
the
prevention,
suppression,
or
6


eradication
of
an
infectious
or
contagious
disease
afflicting
7


an
animal
within
the
state
(Code
section
163.2(2)).
8


FERAL
SWINE
——
PROHIBITION.
The
bill
prohibits
a
person
from
9


owning
or
possessing
feral
swine,
causing
or
allowing
a
feral
10


swine
owned
or
possessed
by
a
person
to
come
into
contact
with
11


another
animal,
or
transporting
a
feral
swine
in
this
state.
12


“Feral
swine”
is
defined
as
any
animal
classified
as
belonging
13


to
the
genus
sus
regardless
of
its
species,
if
the
animal
fails
14


to
comply
with
inspection,
testing,
or
vaccination
requirements
15


for
an
infectious
or
contagious
disease
that
is
capable
of
16


affecting
swine
as
those
requirements
are
set
forth
in
federal
17


or
state
law.
18


FERAL
SWINE
——
CIVIL
PENALTY
APPLICABLE.
A
person
who
19


violates
the
feral
swine
prohibition
is
subject
to
a
civil
20


penalty
of
not
more
than
$25,000
for
a
continuous
violation
21


(i.e.,
a
violation
that
extends
over
the
course
of
continuous
22


days).
The
civil
penalty
does
not
apply
if
the
person
is
23


subject
to
another
civil
penalty
for
the
same
offense
(Code
24


section
163.61).
25


NONFERAL
SWINE
——
HUNTING
PRESERVES.
The
bill
also
provides
26


that
a
person
may
apply
for
and
be
issued
a
license
as
a
hunting
27


preserve
(Code
chapter
484B)
in
order
to
confine
swine
for
28


the
purpose
of
breeding
and
hunting.
Currently,
the
license
29


applies
to
land
reserved
for
hunting
game
birds
and
certain
30


animals
classified
as
nondomesticated
ungulates.
Hunting
31


preserves
are
regulated
by
the
department
of
natural
resources.
32


HUNTING
PRESERVES
——
APPLICABLE
REGULATIONS.
The
bill
33


provides
that
a
hunting
preserve
may
also
operate
for
hunting
34


any
species
of
swine
so
long
as
the
swine
are
not
classified
as
35

feral.
The
bill
refers
to
ungulates
and
nonferal
swine
as
game
1


animals
and
many
of
the
requirements
that
currently
apply
to
2


ungulates
would
apply
to
nonferal
swine,
including
requirements
3


associated
with
license
applications
(Code
section
484B.4),
4


fence
boundaries
and
signs
(Code
section
484B.5),
records
5


and
reports
(Code
section
484B.7),
transportation
tags
(Code
6


section
484B.9),
health
(Code
section
484B.12),
and
refusal
to
7


renew
a
license
(Code
section
484B.13).
8


HUNTING
PRESERVES
——
SPECIAL
REGULATIONS.
The
bill
also
9


provides
special
requirements
applicable
to
confining
swine
10


as
part
of
a
hunting
preserve.
An
application
must
include
11


a
health
certificate
issued
by
a
licensed
veterinarian.
12


The
confined
swine
must
be
born
and
raised
in
captivity.
13


The
confined
swine
must
be
