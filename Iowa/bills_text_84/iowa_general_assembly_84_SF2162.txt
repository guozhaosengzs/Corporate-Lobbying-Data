EXPLANATION
13


This
bill
applies
to
the
low-income
housing
tax
credit
14


program
administered
through
the
Iowa
finance
authority
15


pursuant
to
Code
section
16.52.
16


The
Iowa
finance
authority
is
required
to
adopt
rules
17


and
allocation
procedures
for
the
allocation
of
the
federal
18


low-income
housing
tax
credits
based
on
several
factors
listed
19


in
Code
section
16.52.
The
Iowa
finance
authority
incorporates
20


the
factors
into
a
qualified
allocation
plan,
which
it
then
21


uses
to
analyze
and
score
applications
for
the
tax
credit.
22


Under
the
current
qualified
allocation
plan,
the
Iowa
23


finance
authority
considers
local
government
contributions
24


as
one
of
its
scoring
factors
relating
to
the
location
of
25


the
proposed
housing
project,
but
does
not
consider
the
26


value
of
a
tax
exemption
provided
by
a
city
or
county,
27


or
an
agency,
department,
or
similar
subunit
thereof,
to
28


be
a
local
government
contribution.
The
bill
amends
Code
29


section
16.52
to
provide
that
if
the
Iowa
finance
authority
30


considers
local
government
contributions
in
adopting
and
31


applying
its
allocation
rules,
it
shall
consider
the
value
32


of
a
tax
exemption
provided
by
a
city
or
county,
or
an
33


agency,
department,
or
similar
subunit
thereof,
to
be
a
local
34


government
contribution.
