EXPLANATION
2


This
bill
prohibits
the
use
of
automated
traffic
law
3


enforcement
systems,
except
for
the
continuation
of
a
city’s
4


existing
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
program
for
a
5


limited
period.
6


Automated
traffic
law
enforcement
systems,
commonly
known
7


as
“red
light
cameras”
or
“speed
cameras”,
are
devices
with
8


one
or
more
sensors
which
work
in
conjunction
with
a
traffic
9


control
signal
or
device
or
a
speed-measuring
device
to
produce
10


recorded
images
of
vehicles
being
operated
in
violation
of
11


traffic
or
speed
laws.
12


Under
the
bill,
the
use
of
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
13


systems
is
prohibited
as
of
the
effective
date
of
the
bill.
14


However,
a
local
authority
that
currently
uses
automated
15


traffic
law
enforcement
systems
may
continue
the
use
of
one
16


or
more
of
those
systems
to
the
extent
necessary
to
hold
the
17


city
harmless
under
the
terms
of
any
existing
contracts
for
18


equipment
or
services.
A
city
may
not
extend
or
renew
an
19


existing
contract
or
enter
into
any
new
contract
after
the
20


effective
date
of
the
bill.
21


A
local
authority’s
ordinance
authorizing
the
use
of
22


automated
traffic
law
enforcement
systems
shall
become
void
23


upon
the
expiration
of
all
related
contracts,
but
notices
of
24


violations
mailed
or
citations
issued
under
that
ordinance
25


shall
not
be
invalidated
and
shall
be
processed
according
to
26


the
prior
law.
27


The
bill
directs
that,
from
the
civil
fines
collected
by
a
28


city
from
the
use
of
automated
traffic
law
enforcement
systems,
29


the
amount
necessary
to
satisfy
contractual
obligations
30


relating
to
the
use
of
the
systems
shall
be
retained
by
the
31


city.
Moneys
in
excess
of
that
amount
are
to
be
deposited
in
32


the
road
use
tax
fund.
33


The
bill
is
effective
upon
enactment.
