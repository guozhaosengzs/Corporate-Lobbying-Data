EXPLANATION
16


This
bill
allows
taxpayers
to
take
deductions
for
certain
17


disaster-related
casualty
losses.
18


In
2008,
the
midwest
suffered
significant
property
casualty
19


losses
due
to
natural
disasters.
In
response,
the
federal
20


government
passed
the
Heartland
Disaster
Relief
Act
which
21


amended
the
casualty
loss
provisions
of
the
Internal
Revenue
22


Code.
In
2009
and
2010,
the
state
of
Iowa
did
not
conform
23


to
the
federal
provisions
related
to
the
computation
of
net
24


income.
25


This
bill
allows
Iowa
taxpayers
to
take
the
deductions
for
26


the
2008
tax
year.
27


A
claim
for
credit
or
refund
of
income
taxes
paid
that
arises
28


under
the
provisions
of
the
bill
is
considered
timely
if
such
29


a
claim
is
filed
with
the
department
of
revenue
on
or
before
30


October
1,
2011.
31


The
bill
is
effective
upon
enactment
and
applies
32


retroactively
for
the
2008
tax
year.
