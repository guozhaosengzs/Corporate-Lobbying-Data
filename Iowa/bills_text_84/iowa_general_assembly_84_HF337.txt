EXPLANATION
13


This
bill
relates
to
specified
aspects
of
the
regulation
of
14


delayed
deposit
services
businesses.
15


The
bill
provides
that
the
annual
percentage
rate
applicable
16


to
delayed
deposit
services
transactions
shall
not
exceed
36
17


percent,
as
computed
pursuant
to
the
federal
Truth
in
Lending
18


Act,
unless
a
licensee
elects
to
impose
an
alternative
higher
19


rate.
This
is
the
same
percentage
rate
limitation
imposed
as
20


a
restriction
or
safeguard
for
military
personnel
pursuant
to
21


10
U.S.C.
49
§
987.
Such
an
election
shall
make
requirements
22


regarding
indebtedness
limitations
and
electronic
database
23


reporting
requirements
specified
in
a
subsequent
section
of
the
24


bill
applicable.
25


The
bill
provides
that
a
licensee
must
disclose
to
the
maker
26


of
a
check
that
the
licensee
cannot
initiate
debt
collection
27


procedures,
civil
court
proceedings,
or
arbitration
to
collect
28


an
unpaid
check
unless
the
licensee
has
provided
the
maker
29


of
a
check
the
opportunity
to
repay
the
obligation
without
30


any
charges,
other
than
the
current
$15
penalty,
in
biweekly
31


payments
of
not
more
than
10
percent
of
the
face
of
the
check
32


until
the
debt
is
paid
in
full.
The
bill
adds
that
during
this
33


repayment
period
the
licensee
cannot
sell
or
transfer
the
debt
34


owing
on
the
unpaid
check
and
the
loan
shall
not
be
considered
35

to
be
in
default.
However,
if
the
maker
of
the
check
fails
1


to
honor
the
repayment
obligation,
the
bill
provides
that
the
2


loan
shall
be
placed
in
default.
The
bill
makes
the
failure
to
3


conform
with
these
provisions
a
prohibited
act
on
the
part
of
4


the
licensee,
which
could
subject
the
licensee
to
disciplinary
5


action
as
specified
in
Code
section
533D.12.
6


Additionally,
the
bill
changes
a
current
provision
that
7


prohibits
a
licensee
from
holding
or
agreeing
to
hold
a
8


check
for
more
than
31
days
to
a
modified
provision
that
the
9


licensee
cannot
hold
or
agree
to
hold
a
check
for
less
than
14
10


days.
The
bill
also
prohibits
a
licensee
from
entering
into
11


another
transaction
with
the
maker
of
a
check
who
already
has
12


a
transaction
outstanding
with
the
licensee
or
from
entering
13


into
a
new
transaction
within
two
days
of
the
conclusion
14


of
the
previous
transaction,
unless
the
maker
acknowledges
15


in
writing
specified
restrictions
relating
to
successive
16


transactions,
applicable
penalties,
and
the
opportunity
to
17


repay
the
obligation
in
installments
in
the
event
the
check
is
18


not
negotiable.
19


As
previously
indicated,
the
bill
authorizes
a
licensee
to
20


impose
an
annual
percentage
rate
which
exceeds
36
percent
by
21


filing
with
the
superintendent
of
banking
a
written
notice
22


of
intent.
If
this
election
is
made,
it
shall
apply
to
all
23


transactions
entered
into
by
the
licensee.
The
bill
provides
24


that
a
licensee
may
discontinue
imposition
of
an
alternative
25


interest
rate
and
consent
to
imposition
of
the
36
percent
rate
26


otherwise
applicable,
and
a
licensee
previously
imposing
the
27


36
percent
rate
may
elect
to
impose
the
alternative
rate,
by
28


submitting
a
request
to
the
superintendent
no
more
often
than
29


annually.
30


The
bill
provides
that
a
licensee
electing
to
impose
31


an
alternative
annual
percentage
rate
shall
be
prohibited
32


from
entering
into
a
delayed
deposit
services
transaction
33


that
results
in
the
maker
of
the
check
being
indebted
to
34


the
licensee,
or
when

This
provision
of
the
bill
2


takes
effect
October
1,
2011.
Further,
the
bill
requires
a
3


licensee

to

to,
