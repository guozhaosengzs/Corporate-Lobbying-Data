BACKGROUND
——
GENERAL.
This
bill
amends
a
number
of
19


provisions
enacted
in
2019
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
130
(Iowa’s
2019
20


Act).
Division
I
of
that
Act
creates
Code
chapter
204,
the
21


“Iowa
Hemp
Act”
(IHA)
(see
Code
section
204.1),
authorizing
the
22


production
of
a
certain
type
of
cannabis
(sativa
L.).
Division
23


II
of
that
Act
includes
a
number
of
coordinating
provisions,
24


including
amendments
that
remove
hemp
from
the
list
of
schedule
25


I
controlled
substances
(see
Code
chapters
124
and
453B).
26


BACKGROUND
——
JURISDICTION
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
DEPARTMENT


27


OF
AGRICULTURE.
Iowa’s
2019
Act
was
enacted
after
the
28


enactment
of
the
federal
Agriculture
Improvement
Act
of
2018,
29


commonly
known
as
the
2018
farm
bill,
including
provisions
30


allowing
the
production
of
hemp
(7
U.S.C.
§1639o
et
seq.).
The
31


IHA
refers
to
these
provisions
as
the
“federal
hemp
law”
(Code
32


section
204.2).
The
federal
hemp
law
allows
states
and
tribes
33


to
assume
primary
regulatory
authority
over
the
production
of
34


hemp
by
submitting
a
plan
for
approval
by
the
United
States

department
of
agriculture
(USDA).
The
IHA
assigns
principal
1


regulatory
authority
over
hemp
production
to
the
department
2


of
agriculture
and
land
stewardship
(DALS),
which
must
act
in
3


cooperation
with
the
department
of
public
safety
(DPS).
The
4


USDA
has
published
its
interim
rules
to
implement
the
federal
5


hemp
law
(7
C.F.R.
pt.
990).
The
USDA
has
neither
approved
nor
6


disapproved
Iowa’s
state
plan.
7


BACKGROUND
——
JURISDICTION
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
FOOD
AND
8


DRUG
ADMINISTRATION.
By
its
own
terms,
the
federal
hemp
9


law
does
not
affect
or
modify
the
federal
Food,
Drug,
and
10


Cosmetic
Act
(FDCA)
(21
U.S.C.
§301
et
seq.),
and
therefore
the
11


authority
of
the
United
States
food
and
drug
administration
12


(FDA)
to
regulate
human
and
animal
foods
and
additives,
dietary
13


supplements,
human
and
veterinary
drugs,
and
cosmetics
is
14


preserved
(see
7
U.S.C.
§1639r).
15


BACKGROUND
——
IMPLEMENTATION
AND
EFFECTIVE
DATES.
The
16


provisions
of
Iowa’s
2019
Act
that
enacted
the
IHA
took
effect
17


May
13,
2019,
but
will
be
implemented
only
if
the
USDA
approves
18


Iowa’s
state
plan.
The
implementation
date
is
the
publication
19


date
of
the
edition
of
the
Iowa
administrative
bulletin
20


(IAB)
that
includes
a
statement
by
DALS
certifying
approval
21


(2019
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
130,
section
18).
The
coordinating
22


amendments
will
take
effect
on
the
IAB’s
publication
date
and
23


are
therefore
contingent
on
the
IHA’s
implementation
(2019
Iowa
24


Acts,
chapter
130,
section
33).
25


DIVISION
I
——
PRINCIPAL
PROVISIONS.
The
IHA
follows
the
26


federal
hemp
law
by
defining
hemp
as
a
species
of
cannabis
27


(e.g.,
sativa
L.)
having
a
maximum
concentration
of
delta-9
28


tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC)
not
exceeding
three-tenths
of
1
29


percent
as
calculated
on
a
dry
weight
basis.
The
bill
modifies
30


the
testing
methodology
in
accordance
with
the
USDA
interim
31


regulations.
The
bill
requires
testing
that
calculates
a
value
32


produced
from
a
process
referred
to
as
decarboxylation
that
33


determines
the
“total”
potential
delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol
34


which
equals
the
sum
of
the
THC
and
a
related
compound,

DIVISION
I
——
REGULATION
OF
HEMP
PRODUCTS.
The
IHA
defines
3


a
hemp
product
as
derived
from
or
made
by
processing
hemp
or
4


parts
of
hemp.
Generally,
the
IHA
allows
a
person
to
engage
5


in
the
retail
sale
of
a
hemp
product
so
long
as
the
hemp
was
6


produced
in
this
state
or
another
state
in
compliance
with
the
7


federal
hemp
law
(Code
section
204.7(9)).
The
bill
provides
8


that
the
sale
of
a
hemp
product
is
authorized
if
allowed
by
the
9


FDCA
or
other
applicable
federal
law.
10


DIVISION
I
——
SPECIAL
REGULATIONS
APPLICABLE
TO
CONSUMABLE
11


HEMP
PRODUCTS.
The
bill
amends
the
IHA
by
defining
a
12


consumable
hemp
product
as
a
hemp
product
that
may
be
13


introduced
into
a
human
or
animal
body
either
directly
or
14


via
a
device
(e.g.,
a
skin
patch,
pipe,
cigarette,
cigar,
or
15


cigarillo)
(Code
section
204.2).
The
bill
prohibits
a
person
16


from
processing
or
otherwise
manufacturing,
transporting,
17


delivering,
marketing,
selling,
distributing,
possessing,
18


or
using
a
consumable
hemp
product.
A
person
violating
19


the
prohibition
is
guilty
of
a
serious
misdemeanor.
This
20


prohibition
does
not
apply
to
the
extent
that
the
FDCA
or
other
21


applicable
federal
law
authorizes
or
recognizes
the
processing,
22


manufacture,
transportation,
delivery,
marketing,
sale,
23


distribution,
possession,
or
use
of
a
consumable
hemp
product
24


for
its
intended
use
by
a
method
for
introduction
into
the
body
25


of
a
human
or
animal.
The
bill
also
requires
a
person
who
sells
26


a
consumable
hemp
product
on
a
retail
basis
as
authorized
by
27


the
FDCA
to
notify
retail
purchasers
of
the
consumable
hemp
28


product’s
intended
use.
The
notice
must
be
posted
in
a
manner
29


and
format
required
by
rules
adopted
by
DALS.
30


DIVISION
I
——
WRONGFULLY
IDENTIFYING
HEMP.
The
bill
31


amends
Code
section
718.6
to
prohibit
a
person
from
knowingly
32


identifying
a
controlled
substance
as
hemp
or
a
hemp
product
to
33


a
law
enforcement
officer.
Generally,
the
person
who
commits
34


the
offense
is
guilty
of
a
simple
misdemeanor.
However,

be
charged
is
punishable
as
a
serious
or

3


or

4


DIVISION
II
——
COORDINATING
PROVISIONS.
The
bill
makes
5


changes
to
provisions
in
division
II
of
the
2019
Iowa
Act.
6


Specifically,
it
includes
provisions
that
account
for
the
IHA’s
7


new
method
of
testing
hemp
based
on
the
total
sum
of
THC
and
8


THC-A
compounds.
It
also
provides
for
the
disposal
of
a
crop
9


according
to
an
order
issued
by
DALS.
10


APPLICABLE
CIVIL
PENALTIES.
A
person
who
violates
a
11


provision
of
the
IHA
is
subject
to
a
civil
penalty
of
not
12


less
than
$500
and
not
more
than
$2,000
with
each
day
of
a
13


continuing
offense
considered
as
a
separate
offense
(Code
14


section
204.12).
DALS
or
the
attorney
general
may
seek
15


injunctive
relief
by
petitioning
a
court
(Code
section
204.13).
16


CRIMINAL
PENALTIES.
A
simple
misdemeanor
is
punishable
by
17


confinement
for
no
more
than
30
days
or
a
fine
of
at
least
$65
18


but
not
more
than
$625
or
by
both.
A
serious
misdemeanor
is
19


punishable
by
confinement
for
no
more
than
one
year
and
a
fine
20


of
at
least
$315
but
not
more
than
$1,875.
21


DIVISION
III
——
CONTINGENT
EFFECTIVE
DATE.
The
bill
takes
22


effect
on
the
implementation
date
of
Code
chapter
204,
unless
23


DALS,
acting
in
coordination
with
DPS,
determines
that
the
24


provisions
must
be
submitted
to
the
USDA
for
approval.
In
that
25


case,
the
provisions
take
effect
when
DALS
publishes
a
notice
26


of
the
USDA’s
approval
in
the
IAB.
