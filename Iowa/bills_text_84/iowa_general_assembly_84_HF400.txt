EXPLANATION
21


This
bill
establishes
a
statewide
program
to
improve
sight
22


distance
at
passive
highway-rail
grade
crossings.
23


A
passive
highway-rail
grade
crossing
is
defined
as
24


a
location
where
a
public
or
private
roadway,
including
25


associated
sidewalks
and
pathways,
crosses
one
or
more
railroad
26


tracks
at
grade,
if
the
location
is
equipped
solely
with
one
or
27


more
signs,
pavement
markings,
or
other
such
traffic-control
28


devices
that
are
not
activated
by
trains.
29


The
bill
provides
technical
definitions
for
“clearing
sight
30


distance”,
which
refers
to
the
view
down
the
track
in
either
31


direction
from
a
stopping
point
on
the
road
15
feet
from
the
32


track;
“corner
sight
distance”,
which
refers
to
the
distance
33


required
for
a
road
user
traveling
at
the

limit
to

34


an

to
stop
at
least
15

the
track;
and
“stopping

distance”,
which
refers
to
the
1


distance
required
for
a
vehicle
traveling
at
the
speed
limit
2


to
safely
stop
at
least
15
feet
from
the
track.
The
term
“road
3


user”
refers
to
a
motor
vehicle
operator,
a
bicyclist,
or
a
4


pedestrian,
including
a
person
with
one
or
more
disabilities,
5


who
is
on
a
public
road,
street,
or
highway
or
a
private
6


roadway,
including
sidewalks
and
pathways.
7


The
bill
requires
the
department
of
transportation
to
8


establish
a
program
to
periodically
check
the
adequacy
9


of
clearing
sight
distance,
corner
sight
distance,
and
10


stopping
sight
distance
at
passive
highway-rail
grade
11


crossings.
Inspectors
authorized
by
the
department
may
12


enter
public
or
private
property
to
perform
their
duty
and
13


evaluate
obstructions
caused
by
structures,
topography,
14


standing
railroad
equipment,
or
trees
or
other
vegetation.
15


The
department
is
required
to
take
action
to
address
the
16


obstruction,
including
but
not
limited
to
ordering
the
17


property
owner
to
remove
or
mitigate
an
obstruction
located
on
18


private
property;
if
the
obstruction
is
on
public
property,
19


providing
written
notice
of
the
obstruction
to
the
state
or
20


local
government
agency
with
maintenance
responsibility
for
21


the
property;
installing
additional
traffic
control
devices;
22


or
lowering
the
speed
limit
on
the
portion
of
the
highway
23


approaching
the
passive
highway-rail
grade
crossing
or
24


installing
advisory
speed
signs.
25


A
private
property
owner
or
a
public
agency
has
60
days
26


in
which
to
comply
with
an
order
to
remove
or
mitigate
an
27


obstruction
or
appeal
the
order
to
the
department.
A
civil
28


penalty
of
not
less
than
$100
and
not
more
than
$500
for
each
29


day
the
obstruction
continues
shall
be
imposed
on
a
private
30


property
owner
who
fails
to
comply
with
either
an
original
31


order
or
an
order
following
an
appeal;
however,
the
department
32


has
discretion
to
waive
part
or
all
of
the
amount
of
the
33


penalty.
If
a
government
agency
fails
to
comply
with
an
order,
34


the
department
may
remove
or

the
obstruction
and
then

Under
current
law,
a
motor
vehicle
operator
approaching
any
2


railroad
grade
crossing
regulated
by
a
stop
sign,
a
railroad
3


sign
directing
traffic
to
stop,
or
an
official
traffic-control
4


signal
displaying
a
flashing
red
or
steady
circular
red
light
5


is
required
to
stop
prior
to
crossing
the
tracks
at
the
first
6


opportunity
at
either
the
clearly
marked
line
or
at
a
point
7


near
the
crossing
where
the
driver
has
a
clear
view
of
the
8


approaching
train.
The
bill
leaves
that
requirement
in
place
9


for
drivers
approaching
railroad
grade
crossings
with
official
10


traffic-control
signals,
but
provides
specific
requirements
11


for
all
road
users
approaching
passive
highway-rail
grade
12


crossings.
The
bill
requires
a
road
user
to
come
to
a
complete
13


stop
within
50
feet
but
not
less
than
15
feet
before
the
14


nearest
rail
if
the
approaching
train
or
other
railroad
15


equipment
is
likely
to
occupy
the
crossing
before
the
user
can
16


safely
enter
and
clear
the
crossing;
if
a
locomotive
or
other
17


audible
warning
device
is
sounded
by
a
train
approaching
the
18


crossing;
or
if
a
stop
sign
is
posted
at
the
crossing.
While
19


stopped,
the
road
user
shall
listen
and
look
in
both
directions
20


for
an
approaching
train,
and
for
signals
indicating
the
21


approach
of
a
train,
and
shall
not
proceed
until
the
road
user
22


can
do
so
safely.
23


Pursuant
to
current
law,
the
penalty
for
failure
to
stop
as
24


required
at
a
railroad-grade
crossing
is
a
simple
misdemeanor
25


punishable
by
a
scheduled
fine
of
$200.
