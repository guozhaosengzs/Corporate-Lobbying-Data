bill

three
primary
offenses
which
are
part
of
Code
chapter
4


717B.
These
include
animal
abuse
(Code
section
717B.2),
5


animal
neglect
(Code
section
717B.3),
and
animal
torture
(Code
6


section
717B.3A).
The
bill
creates
two
new
nonprimary
criminal
7


offenses
in
Code
chapter
717B
including
animal
abandonment
8


(new
Code
section
717B.3B)
and
animal
endangerment
(new
9


Code
section
717B.3C).
The
bill
also
refers
to
two
other
10


nonprimary
offenses
provided
in
the
Code
chapter
which
include
11


the
abandonment
of
a
cat
or
dog
(Code
section
717B.8)
and
12


injury
or
interference
with
a
police
service
dog
(Code
section
13


717B.9).
All
of
these
primary
and
nonprimary
offenses
are
14


classified
as
animal
mistreatment.
Under
the
bill,
each
of
15


the
primary
offenses
includes
an
enhanced
penalty
that
applies
16


to
a
convicted
person
who
has
previously
committed
any
of
the
17


named
primary
or
nonprimary
offenses
classified
as
animal
18


mistreatment;
or
committed
a
non-Code
chapter
offense
including
19


bestiality
(Code
section
717C.1)
or
an
offense
involving
an
20


animal
contest
(Code
section
717D.4).
21


TYPES
OF
PRIMARY
OFFENSES
——
ABUSE.
Animal
abuse
involves
22


intentionally
injuring
an
animal
by
violence
or
poisoning.
23


The
bill
expands
the
intent
element
by
adding
acting
either
24


knowingly
or
recklessly.
It
also
removes
a
provision
that
25


exempted
a
person
who
acted
with
the
consent
of
the
animal’s
26


owner.
The
bill
reduces
the
penalty
from
an
aggravated
to
a
27


serious
misdemeanor
for
committing
animal
abuse
that
does
not
28


cause
an
animal
serious
injury
or
death
and
retains
the
penalty
29


of
aggravated
misdemeanor
for
committing
animal
abuse
that
30


causes
an
animal
serious
injury
or
death.
The
bill
provides
31


that
the
aggravated
misdemeanor
may
be
enhanced
to
a
class
“D”
32


felony
if
the
person
was
previously
convicted
of
one
of
the
33


named
offenses
classified
as
animal
mistreatment.

_____


involves
failing
to
provide
an
animal
with
adequate
food,
1


water,
or
shelter,
or
torturing
the
animal.
The
bill
rewrites
2


these
requirements
by
requiring
that
an
animal
be
furnished
3


with
adequate
supplies
of
nutritional
food,
access
to
potable
4


water,
adequate
sanitary
conditions,
ventilated
shelter
5


sufficient
to
provide
the
animal
with
protection
from
extreme
6


weather
conditions,
and
necessary
veterinary
care.
The
bill
7


eliminates
the
torture
prohibition.
The
bill
retains
the
8


criminal
penalty
which
is
a
simple
misdemeanor.
However,
the
9


penalty
is
increased
to
a
serious
misdemeanor
if
the
animal
10


suffers
an
injury
and
to
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
if
the
11


animal
suffers
a
serious
injury
or
death.
In
a
case
where
12


the
animal
suffers
a
serious
injury
or
death,
the
aggravated
13


misdemeanor
may
be
enhanced
to
a
class
“D”
felony
if
the
person
14


was
previously
convicted
of
one
of
the
named
offenses.
15


TYPES
OF
PRIMARY
OFFENSES
——
TORTURE.
Animal
torture
16


involves
inflicting
upon
an
animal
severe
physical
pain
with
17


depraved
or
sadistic
intent
to
cause
prolonged
suffering
18


or
death.
The
bill
requires
that
the
act
constitute
an
19


intentional,
knowing,
or
reckless
infliction
of
prolonged
or
20


repeated
physical
pain
that
results
in
suffering
and
serious
21


injury
or
death.
The
bill
replaces
the
current
penalties
for
22


animal
torture.
A
person
is
no
longer
guilty
of
an
aggravated
23


misdemeanor
for
the
first
offense
and
a
class
“D”
felony
for
24


a
subsequent
offense.
Instead,
a
person
is
guilty
of
a
class
25


“D”
felony,
which
is
enhanced
to
a
class
“C”
felony
if
the
26


person
was
previously
convicted
of
one
of
the
named
offenses
27


classified
as
animal
mistreatment.
The
bill
also
eliminates


28


a
requirement
that
a
person
convicted
of
animal
torture
must
29


submit
to
psychological
evaluation
and
treatment.
30


TYPES
OF
NONPRIMARY
OFFENSES

ABANDONMENT.
Animal


31


abandonment
involves
knowingly

in
which
the

does

not
