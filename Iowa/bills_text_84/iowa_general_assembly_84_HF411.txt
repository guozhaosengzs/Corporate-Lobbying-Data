This

relates
to
mechanics’
liens
including
the
1


establishment
of
a
state
construction
registry
for
residential
2


construction
property
and
provides
an

The
bill
changes
all
references
to
“principal
contractor”

and
“contractor”
to
“general
contractor”,
defined
in
the

bill
to
mean
a
person
who
does
work
or
furnishes
materials
6


by
contract,
express
or
implied,
with
an
owner.
“General
7


contractor”
does
not
include
a
person
who
does
work
or
8


furnishes
materials
on
contract
with
an
owner-builder.
9


The
bill
defines
“owner-builder”
as
the
legal
or
equitable
10


titleholder
who
furnishes
material
or
performs
labor
upon
a
11


building,
erection,
or
other

or
who
contracts
12


with
a
subcontractor
to
furnish
material
or
perform
labor
upon

a

and
who
offers

without
occupying

than
one
year
from
the
17


date
the
structure,
property,
development,
or
improvement
18


is
substantially
completed
or
abandoned.
The
bill
extends
19


provisions
currently
in
the
Code
for
general
contractors
to
20


owner-builders.
These
provisions
relate
to
perfecting
a
lien,
21


the
acknowledgment
of
a
lien
that
has
been
satisfied
by
payment
22


of
a
claim,
actions
by
subcontractors
or
owners
to
recover
23


amounts
due,
and
certain
notification
requirements.
The
bill
24


also
extends
provisions
for
general
contractors
relating
to
25


notification
requirements
for
commercial
construction
to
26


owner-builders.
27


The
bill
provides

by
posting
a
verified
statement
of

(the
secretary

which
such
