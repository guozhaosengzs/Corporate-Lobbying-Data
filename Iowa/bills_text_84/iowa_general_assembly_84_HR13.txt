HOUSE
RESOLUTION
NO.
13


BY
SWEENEY


A
Resolution
urging
support
of
efforts
to
improve
the
1


sustainability
of
the
horse
industry.
2


WHEREAS,
the
closing
of
horse
harvesting
facilities
3


in
America
has
decimated
the
equine
industry,
and
has
4


curtailed
the
ability
of
states
and
tribes
to
control
5


the
numbers
of
excess
and
abandoned
horses
on
their
6


lands;
and
7


WHEREAS,
documented
reports
indicate
an
increase
8


of
four
hundred
percent
in
the
number
of
starved,
9


abandoned,
and
neglected
horses
between
2008
and
2009
10


alone;
and
11


WHEREAS,
federal
appropriations
law
contains
a
12


prohibition
on
allowing
federal
dollars
to
be
spent
on
13


salaries
for
inspectors
who
inspect
horses
before
or
14


after
slaughter,
making
it
impossible
for
operations
15


that
want
to
process
horse
meat
to
market
this
16


meat;
and
17


WHEREAS,
this
has
resulted
in
state
budget
increases
18


and
taxpayer
costs
at
a
time
when
states
cannot
afford
19


unnecessary
expense,
and
it
has
severely
impacted
20


the
livestock
industry
as
a
whole
by
eliminating
the
21


salvage
value
of
horses
and
significantly
reducing
the
22


market
value
of
all
horses;
and
23


WHEREAS,
efforts
under
way
to
change
the
federal
24


Taylor
Grazing
Act
of
1934
and
the
federal
Wild
25


Free-Roaming
Horse
and
Burro
Act
of
1971,
expand
herd
26


management
areas,
or
allow
the
use
of
federal
land
for
27


privately
owned
sanctuaries
will
only
exacerbate
