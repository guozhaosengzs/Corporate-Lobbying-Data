life
for

8


WHEREAS,
the

lessons
in
hard
work,
11


character,
and
leadership;

WHEREAS,
all
farms
depend
on
the
contributions
of
16


youth
for
their
successful
operation;

17


WHEREAS,
the
proposed
regulations
would
limit
18


opportunities

agriculture
19


at
a
time
when
the
average
age
of
farmers
continues
