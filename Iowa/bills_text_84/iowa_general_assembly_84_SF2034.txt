EXPLANATION
19


Current
law
provides
an
exception
to
the
requirement
that
a
20


public
corporation
retain
a
portion
of
funds
due
a
contractor
21


on
a
public
improvement
project
in
a
fund
for
the
payment
22


of
claims
for
materials
furnished
and
labor
performed.
The
23


exception
provides
that
a
public
corporation
need
only
retain
24


funds
due
a
supplier
of
material
to
a
general
contractor
if
25


the
supplier
provides
the
general
contractor
with
one
of
two
26


permitted
types
of
notice
after
the
materials
are
supplied.
27


This
bill
provides
that
the
exception
shall
apply
to
both
28


claims
for
labor
and
claims
for
material.
The
bill
also
amends
29


the
notice
requirement
to
provide
that
a
supplier
of
labor
30


or
material
to
a
general
contractor
must
give
only
one
type
31


of
notice,
along
with
a
certified
statement
that
such
notice
32


was
given.
The
bill
provides
that
a
principal
contractor,
as
33


defined
in
the
bill,
shall
not
be
prohibited
from
requesting
34


information
from
a
subcontractor
or
from
an
entity
performing

to
a
subcontractor
regarding

payments
made
to
the
entity
from
the
subcontractor
for

or

materials.
The
bill
provides
that
the
bill
does
not
apply
to
3


claims
for
labor
filed
by
employees
of
principal
contractors

or
employees
of
subcontractors.
