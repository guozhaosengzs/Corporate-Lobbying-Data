EXPLANATION
7


This
bill
relates
to
violations
of
Iowa’s
open
records
8


(Code
chapter
22)
and
public
meetings
(Code
chapter
21)
laws
9


including
the
creation
of
the
Iowa
public
information
board,
10


and
includes
effective
date
provisions.
11


The
bill
increases
civil
penalty
damage
amounts
for
12


violations
of
the
open
records
and
public
meetings
laws
for
13


each
member
of
the
government
body
or
governmental
body
or
each
14


person
who
knowingly
participated
in
the
violation
from
not
15


less
than
$100
and
not
more
than
$500
to
not
less
than
$1,000

to
the

member
of
the
governmental
body
or
each
person
who
20


otherwise
participated
in
the
violation
($100

These
21


changes
also
allow
public
bodies
to
rely
on
advice
received
22


from
the
Iowa
public
information
board
without
penalty
should
23


they
be
subsequently
found
by
a
court
to
be
in
violation
of
24


Code
chapter
21
or
22.
25


The
bill
creates
the
Iowa
public
information
board
as
an
26


independent
agency
to
provide
an
alternative
means
by
which
to
27


secure
compliance
with
and
enforcement
of
the
requirements
of
28


Code
chapters
21
and
22.

board
shall
consist
of
seven
members
appointed
by
the

sufficient,

insufficient,
