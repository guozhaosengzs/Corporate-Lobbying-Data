EXPLANATION
13


This
bill
modifies
Iowa’s
human
services
and
education
14


systems
to
ensure
that
children
start
school
ready
to
learn
and
15


to
increase
Iowa’s
student
achievement
rates.
16


DIVISION
I.
The
bill
requires
registration
of
home
child
17


care
providers.
Code
section
237A.1,
providing
definitions,
18


is
amended
to
define
the
term
“relative”
to
mean
an
adult
19


person
who
is,
or
was
at
any
time,
one
of
a
child’s
relatives
20


that
is
listed
in
the
bill,
by
means
of
blood
relationship,
21


marriage,
or
adoption,
or
is
a
spouse
of
one
of
the
relatives
22


listed
in
the
bill.
The
list
of
relatives
includes
siblings,
23


grandparents,
cousins,
aunts,
and
uncles.
24


Under
current
law
in
Code
section
237A.3,
a
person
or
program
25


providing
child
care
to
five
children
or
fewer
at
any
one
time
26


is
a
child
care
home
provider
and
is
not
required
to
register
27


under
Code
section
237A.3A
as
a
child
development
home.
The
28


bill
repeals
Code
section
237A.3
and
revises
the
definition
of
29


child
development
home
to
mean
care
provided
to
one
or
more
30


children.
The
bill
provides
an
exemption
to
the
registration
31


requirement
for
a
relative
who
provides
child
care
to
only
32


related
children
or
a
person
providing
child
care
to
only
33


children
from
a
single
unrelated
family.
34


References
to
the
term
“child
care
home”
are
eliminated
in
35

various
Code
provisions.
1


DIVISION
II.
The
bill
provides
for
an
increase
in
the
2


amount
generated
by
the
professional
development
supplement
3


categorical
under
the
school
aid
formula,
calculated
to
4


provide
school
districts
with
funding
for
three
additional
days
5


of
professional
development,
which
the
bill
directs
school
6


districts
to
include
in
their
district
professional
development
7


plan.
The
bill
includes
technical
and
conforming
changes.
8


The
division
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
9


section
25B.3.
The
division
requires
that
the
state
cost
of
10


any
state
mandate
included
in
the
division
be
paid
by
a
school
11


district
from
state
school
foundation
aid
received
by
the
12


school
district
under
Code
section
257.16.
The
specification
13


is
deemed
to
constitute
state
compliance
with
any
state
mandate
14


funding-related
requirements
of
Code
section
25B.2.
The
15


inclusion
of
this
specification
is
intended
to
reinstate
the
16


requirement
of
political
subdivisions
to
comply
with
any
state
17


mandates
included
in
the
division.
18


DIVISION
III.
The
bill
amends
the
term
“preschool
budget
19


enrollment”,
effective
upon
enactment,
to
mean
60
percent
of
20


the
actual
enrollment
of
eligible
students
in
the
preschool
21


programming
provided
by
a
school
district
for
budget
years
22


beginning
July
1,
2012.
The
general
assembly
reduced
the
23


percentage
amount
from
60
percent
to
50
percent
in
the
2011
24


legislative
session
for
budget
years
beginning
on
or
after
July
25


1,
2011.
The
term
“preschool
budget
enrollment”
is
used
in
26


determining
the
amount
of
preschool
foundation
aid
a
school
27


district
may
receive.
28


The
bill
increases
from
five
to
seven
the
percentage
of
its
29


budget
enrollment
that
the
district
identifies
as
returning
30


dropouts
and
potential
dropouts
when
requesting
to
use
modified
31


allowable
growth
to
finance
programs
for
returning
dropouts
and
32


dropout
prevention.
The
bill
also
specifies
the
appropriate
33


uses
of
such
funding
by
school
districts,
including
salary
and
34


benefits
for
instructional
staff,
instructional
support
staff,

and
school-based
youth
services
staff
who
are
working
with
1


students
who
are
participating
in
dropout
prevention
programs,
2


alternative
programs,
and
alternative
schools
if
the
staff
3


person’s
time
is
dedicated
to
working
with

4


or
students
who
are
deemed
to
be
at
risk
of
dropping
out,
to
5


provide
services
beyond
those
provided
by
the
school
district
6


to
students
generally;
professional

7


teachers
and

working
with

and

8

strategies;
and

9


resources,
materials,
software,
supplies,
and
purchased
10


services
that
meet
criteria
specified
in
the
bill.
11


The
bill
allows
the
school
board
to
submit
a
request
to
12


the
school
budget
review
committee
for
additional
modified
13


allowable
growth
if
the
funds
generated
under
Code
section
14


257.41
are
insufficient
to
meet
the
dropout
programming
needs
15


of
the
district.
The
bill
also
permits
school
districts
to
use
16


up
to
5
percent
of
the
total
amount
of
the
funds
received
that
17


are
generated
by
a
formula
established
in
Code,
for
purposes
of
18


providing
district-wide
or
building-wide
returning
dropout
and
19


dropout
prevention
programming
targeted
to
students
who
are
not
20


deemed
at
risk
of
dropping
out.
21


The
bill
creates
two
funds
in
the
state
treasury
under
the
22


control
of
the
department
of
education:
(1)
The
pathways
for
23


academic
career
and
employment
fund
for
projects
developed
24


under
the
pathways
for
academic
career
and
employment
program
25


and
provides
a
standing
appropriation
of
$3
million
to
the
26


fund;
and
(2)
A
gap
tuition
assistance
fund
for
purposes
of
27


the
gap
tuition
assistance
program,
and
provides
a
