intersection
at
which
a
device
is
to
be
used
and
provide
1


demonstrable
evidence
that
there
is
a
genuine
safety
need
for
2


the
use
of
such
a
device
at
each
designated
intersection.
The
3


documented
safety
need
shall
be
approved
by
the
department
in
4


accordance
with
nationally
recognized
safety
standards.
For
5


each
designated
intersection
named
in
the
application,
the
6


local
authority
shall
conduct
a
traffic
engineering
study
to
7


determine
whether,
in
addition
to
or
as
an
alternative
to
the
8


traffic-control
signal
monitoring
device,
there
are
other
9


possible
design
or
operational
changes
that
would
be
likely
10


to
reduce
the
number
of
accidents
or
red

violations
at
11


the
intersection.
A
report
of
the
engineering
study
shall

device
at
an
intersection,
16


the
department
shall
only
consider
the
safety
value
of
using
17


such
a
device.
The
generation
of
revenue
through
the
use
of
a
18


traffic-control
signal
monitoring
device
shall
not
be
a
factor
19


in
the
department’s
decision
to
issue
a
permit.
20


e.
Within
three
months
of
receiving
a
properly
completed

local
authority,
the
department
shall
either
22


issue
a
permit
for
the
use
of
the
requested
traffic-control
23


signal
monitoring
device
or
notify
the
local
authority
of
24


the
reason
for
denial
of
the
application.
An
application
25


for
amendment
to
an
existing
permit
or
an
application
for
26


reinstatement
of
a
permit
following
suspension
or

local
32


authority
may
apply
to
the

This
bill
requires
a
local
authority
to
obtain
a
permit
from
1


the
department
of
transportation
to
use
traffic-control
signal
2


monitoring
devices.
3


A
traffic-control
signal
monitoring
device
is
a
device
that
4


works
in
conjunction
with
an
official
traffic
control
signal
5


to
produce
recorded
images
of
motor
vehicles
being
operated
in
6


violation
of
a
red
traffic
signal.
7


The
bill
requires
that
before
a
local
authority
can
employ
8


the
use
of
a
traffic-control
signal
monitoring
device,
the
9


chief
law
enforcement
officer
employed
by
the
local
authority
10


must
request
the
use
of
such
devices
and
the
governing
body
of
11


the
local
authority
must
adopt
a
resolution
approving
their
12


use.
There
must
be
a
public
hearing
on
the
issue
before
the
13


local
authority
enters
into
a
contract
for
the
use
or
purchase
14


of
traffic-control
signal
monitoring
devices.
15


The
department
is
required
to
adopt
rules
relating
to
16


requirements
for
a
permit
and
the
permit
application
process.
17


The
bill
requires
that
an
application
for
a
permit
must
name
18


each
intersection
at
which
a
traffic-control
signal
monitoring
19


device
will
be
used
and
show
that
there
is
a
need
for
a
device
20


at
each
intersection.
A
report
of
an
engineering
study
must
21


be
submitted
along
with
the
application
for
a
permit
and
any
22


subsequent
application
to
amend
the
permit.
23


The
bill
specifies
that
the
department’s
decision
to
issue
24


a
permit
shall
be
based
solely
on
safety
concerns,
and
must
25


not
take
into
account
any
revenue
to
be
derived
by
a
local
26


authority
from
the
use
of
a
traffic-control
signal
monitoring
27


device.
The
department
has
three
months
in
which
to
consider
28


an
application
and
either
issue
a
permit
or
notify
the
local
29


authority
of
the
reason
for
denying
the
application.
Once
30


granted,
a
permit
is
to
undergo
a
departmental
review
every
31


three
years.
The
department
is
authorized
to
establish
32


reasonable
fees
to
cover
its
costs
relating
to
the
issuance
and
33


review
of
permits.
34


The
bill
prohibits
a
local
authority
from
compensating
a
35

manufacturer
or
vendor
of
traffic-control
signal
monitoring
1


devices
from
funds
from
revenues
collected
through
the
use
of
2


a
device.
Compensation
is
to
be
based
on
the
value
of
the
3


equipment
and
not
the
number
of
citations
issued
or
the
revenue
4


generated
by
a
device.
5


The
bill
prohibits
a
law
enforcement
agency
from
issuing
6


citations
based
on
evidence
obtained
from
a
traffic-control
7


signal
monitoring
device
unless
the
agency
employs
at
least
one
8


full-time
certified
peace
officer.
9


The
bill
specifies
that
a
traffic-control
signal
monitoring
10


device
shall
not
be
used
to
produce
an
image
showing
any
person
11


in
a
motor
vehicle.
12


A
local
authority
is
required
to
submit
an
annual
report
13


to
the
department
by
February
1
containing
information
on
14


citations
issued,
the
adjudication
of
violations,
and
penalties
15


collected
from
the
use
of
traffic-control
signal
monitoring
16


devices.
Failure
to
submit
a
report
results
in
the
forfeiture
17


of
revenues
generated
by
the
local
authority’s
traffic-control
18


signal
monitoring
devices
during
the
preceding
calendar
year
19


and
the
current
year.
20


The
bill
provides
a
mechanism
for
complaints
regarding
21


traffic-control
signal
monitoring
devices
to
be
handled
by
the
22


department.
If
a
local
authority
is
found
to
be
violating
the
23


law
regulating
traffic-control
signal
monitoring
devices,
the
24


local
authority
may
be
ordered
by
the
department
to
forfeit
25


revenues
to
the
state
that
were
generated
during
the
time
the
26


violation
was
occurring.
The
attorney
general
is
directed
to
27


enforce
such
an
order
in
the
district
court
of
Polk
county.
28


If
the
department
denies
an
application
for
a
permit
or
29


suspends
or
revokes
an
existing
permit,
the
local
authority
30


is
entitled
to
a
hearing
to
be
held
within
30
days,
and
the
31


department
has
30
days
following
the
hearing
in
which
to
render
32


a
written
decision.
A
local
authority
whose
permit
is
denied
33


or
revoked
is
not
eligible
to
apply
for
a
permit
for
three
34


years.
