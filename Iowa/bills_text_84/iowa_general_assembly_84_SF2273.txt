This

technologists
and
makes
the
provisions
of
Code
chapters
147
17


and

penalty
and
other
regulatory
provisions,
18


applicable
to
other
health
professions
applicable
to
the
19


practice
of

Code
section
147.86
provides
20


that
it
is
a
serious
misdemeanor
to
violate
a
provision
of
21


the
licensing
laws.
The
licensing
program
is
administered
22


and
regulated
by
the
board
of
respiratory
care,
with
four
new
23


members
added;
three
polysomngraphic
technologists
and
one
24


additional
public

practices
under
26


the
general
supervision
of
a
licensed
physician,
providing
27


specifically
enumerated
services
related
to
sleep
disorders.
A

approved
educational
29


program
provides
services
under
the
direct
supervision
of
a
30

31


The
bill
sets
out
educational
standards
and
testing
32


requirements,
and
provides
for
disciplinary
actions.
