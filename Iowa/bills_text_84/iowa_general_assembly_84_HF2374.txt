23


and

sale,

sales
of

the
person’s
state
of
residence,
provided
that
the
dealer’s
1


home
state
extends
similar
privileges
to
a
dealer
licensed
in
2


this
state.
A
dealer
from
another
state
must
furnish
a
surety
3


bond
that
meets
current
requirements
for
motor
vehicle
dealer
4


licensing.
5


A
temporary
permit
issued
under
the

allow
6


a
dealer
to
complete
the
sale
of
a
used
motorcycle
at
a
7


motorcycle
rally.
The
bill
specifies

12


purposes
of
Code
chapter
322C
to
exclude
vehicles
designed
to
13


be
towed
exclusively
by
a
motorcycle.
As
a
result,
sales
of
14


motorcycle
trailers
are
exempt
from
the
travel
trailer
dealer
15


licensing
requirements
and
from
a
specific
provision
in
Code
16


section
322C.12
relating
to
finance
charges
under
a
travel
17


trailer
retail
