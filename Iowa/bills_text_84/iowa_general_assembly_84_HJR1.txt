EXPLANATION
7


This
joint

proposes
an

Constitution
of

and
9


authorization
for
certain
bonds.
10


The
amendment
creates
a
state
general
fund
expenditure
11


limitation.
The
amount
of
the
limitation
is
99
percent
of
the
12


adjusted
revenue
estimate.
The
amendment
defines
adjusted
13


revenue
estimate
and
requires
that
that
estimate
be
determined
14


by
a
revenue
estimating
conference
which
is
to
be
created
by
15


the
general
assembly
by
law.
The
amendment
requires

by
the
governor
in
preparation
17


of
the
governor’s
budget
and
by
the
general
assembly
in
the
18


budget
process.
The
governor
is
prohibited
from
approving
or
19


disapproving
of
appropriations
in
a
manner
that
would
cause
the
20


final
budget
approved
by
the
governor
to
exceed
the
expenditure
21


limitation.
22


The
amendment
also
provides
that
if
a
new
revenue
source
is
23


established
and
implemented,
95
percent
of
the
estimate
of
that
24


new
revenue
shall
be
included
in
the
expenditure
limitation.
25


The
amendment
also
requires
that
the
amount
of
any
surplus
26


which
exceeds
an
amount
equal
to
10
percent
of
the
adjusted
27


revenue
estimate
be
included
in
the
adjusted
revenue
estimate
28


for
the
following
fiscal
year.
Any
surplus
which
is
equal
29


to
10
percent
or
less
of
the
amount
of
the
adjusted
revenue
30


estimate
may
be
included
in
the
following
year’s
adjusted
31


revenue
estimate
if
inclusion
is
approved
in
a
bill
by
at
32


least
three-fifths
of
the
members
elected
to
each
house
of
the
33


general
assembly.
34


The
amendment
requires
that
enactment
of

requires

The
amendment
also
requires
the
state
to
use
generally
9


accepted
accounting
principles
for
state
budgeting
and
10


accounting
purposes.
The
amendment
provides
that
