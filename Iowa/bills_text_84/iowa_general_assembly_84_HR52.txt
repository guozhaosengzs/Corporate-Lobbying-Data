WHEREAS,
the

regulatory
activity
regarding
10


air
quality
and
greenhouse
gases
has
been
referred
11


to
as
a
“train
wreck”
because
of
the
numerous
and
12


overlapping
requirements,
the
uncertainty
created
by
13


the
continual
demand
to
upgrade
or
comply
with
a

set

regulations,
and
the

WHEREAS,

this

the
economy,
jobs,
20


and
competitiveness
of
the
United
States;
nor

the
prospective
22


environmental
benefits
of
its
greenhouse
gas
regulation
23


in
terms
of
the
impact
on
global
climate
change;
and

change
and
improving
air
quality
as
its
first
strategic
26


goal

the
EPA
should
be
27


required
to
identify

economic
burden
and

feasibility
of
implementation
