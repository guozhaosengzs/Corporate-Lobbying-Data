EXPLANATION
28


This
bill
amends
provisions
affecting
entities
known
as
29


cooperative
associations
(sometimes
referred
to
as
simply
30


“associations”
or
“cooperatives”)
organized
under
Code
chapter
31


499,
501,
or
501A.
In
each
case,
the
entity
is
comprised
of
32


members
who
may
vote
upon
certain
issues
affecting
it,
such
33


as
a
candidate
running
as
a
director
on
its
board
or
another
34


question
involving
its
management
or
continuation
(e.g.,

merger
proposal)
as
required
by
statute
or
in
its
articles
of
1


incorporation
or
articles
of
organization.
The
bill
provides
2


that
members
may
vote
by
an
“alternative
voting
method”,
which
3


provides
that
a
member
may
vote
by
electronic,
telephonic,
4


the
internet,
or
other
means
that
reasonably
allows
members
5


the
opportunity
to
vote,
as
provided
in
the
entity’s
articles
6


or
by
its
board.
The
provisions
allowing
for
voting
by
an
7


alternative
voting
method
are
based
on
the
procedure
referred
8


to
as
an
“alternative
voting
ballot”
currently
provided
in
Code
9


chapter
501A.
The
bill
changes
its
name
but
not
its
definition.
10


The
bill
also
provides
that
a
member
of
a
cooperative
11


association
may
cast,
in
advance
of
a
meeting,
a
vote
by
mail
12


ballot
upon
any
proposition
of
which
the
member
has
been
13


previously
notified
in
writing.
