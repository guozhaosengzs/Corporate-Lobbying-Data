An

principal
reasons
for


13


its
action
pursuant
to
section
17A.5
a
concise
statement
14


of
the
principal
reasons
for
and
against

overruling
16


considerations
urged
against
the
rule


and,
if
applicable,
a
17


brief
explanation
of
the
principal
reasons
for
its
failure

provide
in

for
the
waiver
of
the
rule
in
specified
19


situations
if
no
such
waiver
provision
is
included
in
the
rule.
20


This
explanatory
requirement
does
not
apply
when
the
agency
21


adopts
a
rule
that
only
defines
the
meaning
of
a
provision
of
22


law
if
the
agency
does
not
possess
delegated
authority
to
bind
23


the
courts
to
any
extent
with
its
definition.
In
addition,
if
24


requested
to
do
so
by
an
interested
person,
either
prior
to
25


adoption
or
within
thirty
days
thereafter,

agency
shall
26


issue
a
concise
statement
of
the
principal
reasons
for
and
27


against
the
rule
adopted,
incorporating
therein
the
reasons
for
28


overruling
considerations
urged
against
the
rule.
This
concise
29


statement
shall
be
issued
either
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
30


the
rule
or
within
thirty-five
days
after
the
agency
receives
31


the
request.
32


3.
a.


When
an
agency
for
good
cause
finds
that
notice
and
33


public
participation
would
be
unnecessary,
impracticable,
or
34


contrary
to
the
public
interest,
the
provisions
of

and

brief
statement
of
the

for
the
finding,
or
a
3


statement
that
the
rule
is
within
a
very
narrowly
tailored
4


category
of
rules
whose
issuance
has
previously
been
exempted
5


from
subsection
1
by
a
special
rule
relying
on
this
provision
6


and
including
such
a
finding
and
statement
of
reasons
for
the
7


entire
category.
A
rule
adopted
pursuant
to
this
subsection


8


shall
only
remain
in
effect
for
one
hundred
eighty
days,
unless
9


a
shorter
period
is
specified
in
the
rule.
10


b.
If
the
administrative
rules
review
committee
by
a
11


two-thirds
vote,
the
governor,
or
the
attorney
general
files
12


with
the
administrative
code
editor
an
objection
to
the
13


adoption
of
any
rule
pursuant
to
this
subsection
,
that
rule
14


shall
cease
to
be
effective
one
hundred
eighty
days
after
15


the
date
the
objection
was
filed.
A
copy
of
the
objection,
16


properly
dated,
shall
be
forwarded
to
the
agency

18


pursuant

this
subsection
,
the
burden
of
proof
shall
be
on

the
agency
to
show
that
the
procedures
of
subsection
1
were
20


impracticable,
unnecessary,
or
contrary
to
the
public
interest
21


and
that,
if
a
category
of
rules
was
involved,
the
category
was
22


very
narrowly
tailored.

of
a
proposed

a
substantial


an
adverse
impact
on
small

business
by
using
a
method
discussed

if
the

finds

the
method
is
legal
and
feasible
in
meeting
29


the
statutory
objectives
which
are
the
basis
of
the
proposed
30


rule.
For
purposes
of

review,

be
deemed
to
be
aggrieved
or

“which
is
more
hospitable,
16


obtains
more
input
from
the
citizens
of
Iowa
and
is
more
17


transparent”.
18


The
bill
amends
Code
section
17A.4
to
require
administrative
19


agencies,
when
feasible,
to
hold
rulemaking
hearings
in
20


varied
locations
throughout
the
state
and
to
allow
citizens
to
21


participate
in
administrative
rules
hearings
remotely
through
22


electronic
means.
23


The
bill
requires
that
every
adopted
rule
must
be
24


accompanied
by
a
concise
statement
of
the
principal
reasons
25


for
and
against
the
rule
adopted.
Under
current
law
such
a
26


statement
is
only
provided
on
request.
27


The
bill
also
provides
that
so-called
“emergency”
rules,
28


adopted
without
notice
and
public
participation,
are
in
effect
29


for
only
180
days.
30


The
bill
amends
Code
section
17A.4A
to
revise
the
procedure
31


for
requesting
a
regulatory
analysis
for
proposed
rules.
32


This
analysis
required
under
current
law
is
essentially
a
33


cost-benefit
study
identifying
the
impact
of
a
rule
on
the
34


affected
public
and,
in
the
case
of
a
rule
that
would
have
a

substantial
impact
on
small
business,
the
regulatory
analysis
1


must
contain
a
discussion
of
whether
it
would
be
feasible
and
2


practicable
to
reduce
the
impact
of
the
rule
on
small
business.
3


The
bill
requires
an
analysis
on
every
new
rule
which
has
an
4


adverse
impact
on
small
business
and
requires
the
analysis
to
5


be
published
in
the
Iowa
administrative
bulletin
along
with
the
6


new
rule.
If
an
agency
determines
that
it
would
not
be
legal
7


and
feasible
to
reduce
the
adverse
impact
on
small
business,
a
8


small
business
would
have
judicial
standing
to
challenge
that
9


determination
in
district
court.
The
bill
also
requires
a
10


periodic
review
of
all
rules
to
minimize
the
economic
impact
11


of
the
rules
on
small
businesses.
The
initial
review
must
be
12


completed
by
July
1,
2013,
and
will
be
repeated
every
five
13


years.
14


The
bill
creates
new
Code
section
17A.4B
to
provide
that
if
15


required
by
statute,
an
agency
shall
create
an
ad
hoc
group
to
16


review
draft
rule
proposals
prior
to
commencing
a
rulemaking
17


proceeding.
Where
a
statute
does
not
require
this
review,
the
18


bill
allows
an
agency
to
create
such
a
review
group.
Members
19


are
appointed
by
the
agency
and
the
composition
must
adequately
20


represent
a
fair
balance
of
the
interests
affected
by
the
rule.
21


Once
such
a
group
is
created,
the
agency
may
only
commence
22


rulemaking
after
the
group
has
considered
the
draft
rule
23


proposal
in
question.
The
bill
is
based
on
similar
provisions
24


found
in
the
federal
Administrative
Procedures
Act.
25


The
bill
creates
new
Code
section
17A.6A
to
require
that
each
26


agency
make
available
a
searchable
database
and
internet
site
27


detailing
all
of
the
rules
promulgated
by
the
agency.
28


The
bill
amends
Code
section
17A.7
to
require
that
each
29


agency
review
all
of
its
administrative
rules
on
a
five-year
30


cycle.
31


The
bill
amends
Code
section
17A.23
to
establish
a
new
rule
32


of
statutory
construction:
Unless
otherwise
specifically
33


provided
in
statute,
any
grant
of
rulemaking
authority
shall
34


be
construed
narrowly.

The
bill
creates
Code
section
17A.24
which
provides
that
1


state
implementation
of
a
federal
statute,
regulation,
or
2


policy
by
a
state
administrative
agency
shall
not
exceed
the
3


specific
requirements
of
the
federal
statute,
regulation,
4


or
policy,
except
as
specifically
allowed
by
state
law.
5


Any
portion
of
a
state
rule
or
policy
in
violation
of
this
6


requirement
is
void.
7


The
bill
creates
a
commission
to
comprehensively
review
8


and
assess
the
effects
of
current
and
proposed
environmental
9


protection
and
department
of
natural
resources
rules
on
10


Iowa
cities
over
a
10-year
period.
The
bill
defines
the
11


commission’s
membership,
mandates
at
least
three
public
12


hearings
throughout
Iowa,
and
establishes
basic
rules
for
the
13


commission.
The
commission
terminates
upon
submission
of
its
14


report
in
January
of
2013.
