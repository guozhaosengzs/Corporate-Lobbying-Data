EXPLANATION
18


BACKGROUND.
The
“Iowa
Business
Corporation
Act”
(Code
19


chapter
490),
a
model
Act
adopted
by
the
American
Bar
20


Association,
governs
the
requirements
for
the
creation,
21


organization,
and
operation
of
corporations
and
the
22


relationship
between
shareholders,
directors,
and
officers
of
23


the
corporation.
Generally,
the
Act’s
provisions
establish
24


default
requirements
and
procedures
which
may
be
modified
by
a
25


corporation’s
articles
of
incorporation
or
bylaws.
26


PUBLIC
CORPORATIONS.
A
public
corporation
is
a
corporation
27


that
has
a
class
of
voting
stock
that
is
listed
on
a
national
28


securities
exchange
or
held
of
record
by
more
than
2,000
29


shareholders
(Code
section
490.140).
The
bill
amends
the
30


definition
to
eliminate
the
reference
to
a
class
of
shares
31


or
number
of
shareholders.
It
provides
that
a
corporation
32


is
public
if
traded
in
a
market
maintained
by
a
member
of
33


the
national
securities
association.
The
bill
also
amends
34


a
provision
regulating
shareholder
agreements
that
govern
a
35


-58-


LSB
5446HV
(2)
84


da/nh

H.F.
2426


corporation’s
corporate
affairs
including
by
eliminating
or
1


restricting
the
powers
of
its
board
of
directors
(Code
section
2


490.732).
Specifically,
the
bill
provides
that
a
shareholder
3


agreement
is
automatically
terminated
when
the
corporation
4


becomes
public.
These
provisions
take
effect
January
1,
2015.
5


NOTICES,
DOCUMENTS,
AND
COMMUNICATION.
A
notice
must
be
6


in
writing
unless
oral
notice
is
reasonable
(Code
section
7


490.141).
The
bill
requires
that
notices
be
in
English.
8


It
provides
for
the
electronic
transmission
and
receipt
9


and
acknowledgment
of
information.
The
bill
replaces
the
10


requirement
that
documents
be
executed
with
a
requirement
11


that
they
be
signed,
including
documents
associated
with
12


the
adoption
or
abandonment
of
articles
of
merger
or
share
13


exchange
(Code
sections
490.1106
and
490.1108).
The
bill
also
14


authorizes
a
corporation
to
keep
its
records
in
an
electronic
15


form
so
long
as
it
can
be
converted
into
a
paper
form
(Code
16


section
490.1601).
The
corporation
is
required
to
deliver
a
17


written
notice,
report,
or
statement
to
shareholders
who
share
18


a
common
address,
complies
with
delivery
requirements,
by
19


delivering
to
that
address,
unless
a
shareholder
makes
a
timely
20


objection
(Code
section
490.144).
21


QUALIFIED
DIRECTORS.
In
a
number
of
circumstances
a
22


director
must
be
considered
“disinterested”
when
taking
an
23


action
affecting
the
welfare
of
the
corporation.
The
bill
24


eliminates
the
term
“disinterested”
and
replaces
it
with
25


“qualified”
(Code
section
490.143;
see
Code
sections
490.853
26


and
490.855).
The
bill
requires
a
director
to
be
qualified
27


under
different
circumstances
which
may
involve
board
action
28


or
court
proceedings.
For
purposes
of
dismissing
a
derivative
29


proceeding
by
a
court
based
on
a
good-faith
determination
of
30


directors
(Code
section
490.744),
directors
are
qualified
if
31


they
do
not
have
a
material
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
32


proceeding
or
a
material
relationship
with
a
person
who
has
33


such
an
interest.
For
purposes
of
advancing
expenses
to
a
34


board
member
before
the
disposition
of
a
case
(Code
section

or
later
indemnifying
a
director
(Code
section
1


490.855),
the
authorization
must
be
made
by
directors
who
are
2


qualified
because
they
are
not
parties
to
the
proceeding,
do
3


not
have
a
conflicting
interest
in
the
related
transaction,
4


and
do
not
have
a
material
relationship
with
a
director
5


who
is
a
party
or
has
a
conflicting
interest.
For
purposes
6


of
voting
to
excuse
a
director
from
a
conflicting
interest
7


transaction
(Code
section
490.862),
the
vote
must
be
taken
8


by
directors
who
are
qualified
because
they
do
not
have
a
9


conflict
or
have
a
material
relationship
with
the
director
who
10


does
have
a
conflict.
For
purposes
of
determining
whether
a
11


director
may
take
advantage
of
a
business
opportunity
because
12


other
directors
disclaimed
the
corporation’s
interest
in
the
13


opportunity
(Code
section
490.870),
the
directors
are
qualified
14


if
the
business
opportunity
was
a
conflicting
interest
15


transaction
for
those
directors.
16


DIRECTORS
AND
OFFICERS
——
FUNCTIONS
AND
DUTIES.
Generally,
17


a
corporation
must
have
a
board
of
directors,
unless
dispensed
18


with
pursuant
to
a
shareholder
agreement
(Code
sections
490.801
19


and
490.732).
The
bill
provides
that
the
business
affairs
of
a
20


corporation
may
be
subject
to
the
directors’
oversight
rather
21


than
direct
management.
It
authorizes
a
corporate
officer
to
22


designate
recipients
of
compensation
awards
(e.g.,
rights,
23


options,
or
warrants
associated
with
shares)
(Code
section
24


490.624).
The
bill
substitutes
the
term
“functions”
in
lieu
25


of
“duties”
in
some
places
when
referring
to
an
officer’s
26


obligations
(Code
section
490.841).
27


SHAREHOLDER
MEETINGS
——
WRITTEN
CONSENT
IN
LIEU
OF
HOLDING
28


MEETINGS.
Shareholders
are
allowed
to
act
by
written
consent
29


without
holding
a
meeting
if
the
action
is
taken
by
unanimous
30


written
consent
(Code
section
490.704).
The
bill
provides
31


that
a
corporation’s
articles
of
incorporation
may
provide
for
32


shareholder
action
by
less
than
unanimous
written
consent,
33


if
a
written
consent
is
signed
by
shareholders
having
the

minimum
number
of

action
at
a
shareholder
meeting
assuming
that
all
shareholders
1


entitled
to
vote
were
present.
It
creates
a
corresponding
2


exception
to
the
requirement
that
a
corporation
must
hold
at
3


least
one
annual
shareholder
meeting,
presumably
to
elect
4


directors
(Code
sections
490.701
and
490.803),
by
providing
5


that
the
annual
meeting
is
not
necessary
when
directors
are
6


elected
by
the
written
consent
of
shareholders.
The
bill
7


also
provides
a
number
of
procedures
for
providing
notice
to
8


shareholders
and
tabulating
written
consents
delivered
to
the
9


corporation.
10


SHAREHOLDER
MEETING
——
RECORD
DATE.
A
corporation
11


establishes
procedures
for
providing
notice
to
and
voting
by
12


shareholders
at
a
meeting
(or
by
written
consent)
according
to
13


a
record
date.
The
record
date
determines
both
shareholders
14


who
are
entitled
to
notice
of
the
meeting
and
to
vote
at
15


the
meeting.
The
catch-all
provision
states
that
the
record
16


date
is
the
date
before
notice
is
mailed
to
a
voting
group
or
17


shareholders
(Code
section
490.705),
although
a
record
date
18


may
be
established
by
court
order
(Code
section
490.703)
or
19


according
to
the
corporation’s
bylaws
or
board
of
directors
20


(Code
section
490.707).
The
bill
provides
that
there
may
be
21


more
than
one
record
date.
According
to
the
bill,
the
record
22


date
for
a
shareholder
meeting
may
be
established
by
the
23


corporation’s
bylaws
or
by
the
board
unless
the
board
provides
24


a
different
date
to
determine
shareholders
entitled
to
vote
at
25


the
meeting
(Code
section
490.707).
The
bill
provides
that
26


the
corporation
may
be
required
to
provide
a
list
of
names
of
27


shareholders
entitled
to
vote
at
the
meeting,
to
be
available
28


for
inspection
(Code
section
490.720).
The
record
date
is
29


also
used
to
determine
when
appraisal
rights
of
shareholders
30


apply
(Code
section
490.1302).
The
bill
requires
shareholders’
31


appraisal
rights
to
be
triggered
on
the
record
date
by
tying
32


it
only
to
when
a
shareholder
is
entitled
to
receive
notice
33


and
not
when
entitled
to
vote
on
the
matter.
The
bill
also
34


provides
that
the
board
may
fix
a
record
date
for
determining
35


-61-


LSB

when
a

that
is
different
than
1


the
record
date
for
determining
when
a
shareholder
is
entitled
2


to
notice
of
the
meeting.
A
person
who
becomes
a
shareholder
3


after
the
record
date
for
the
notice,
and
is
otherwise
entitled
4


to
vote
at
the
meeting,
may
obtain
the
notice
and
other
5


information
provided
to
the
shareholders
in
preparation
for
the
6


meeting
(Code
sections
490.1602
and
490.1606).
7


SHAREHOLDER
MEETINGS
——
REMOTE
PARTICIPATION.
The
bill
8


authorizes
shareholders
to
participate
in
a
meeting
of
9


shareholders
by
means
of
remote
communication
to
the
extent
10


approved
by
the
board
(Code
section
490.709).
11


ELECTIONS
AND
VOTING
——
CUMULATIVE
VOTING.
Generally,
12


directors
are
elected
by
a
plurality
of
votes
cast
unless
the
13


corporation’s
articles
of
incorporation
provide
for
cumulative
14


voting
allowing
shareholders
to
cast
all
their
votes
for
a
15


single
candidate
(Code
section
490.728).
The
bill
provides
16


that
shareholders
otherwise
entitled
to
vote
cumulatively
17


cannot
so
vote
unless
the
meeting
notice
authorizes
it,
or
a
18


shareholder
who
has
that
right
gives
notice
to
the
corporation
19


before
the
meeting.
20


LEGAL
PROCEEDING
——
DERIVATIVE
ACTIONS.
As
a
result
of
a
21


derivative
action,
the
court
may
order
a
corporation
to
pay
22


the
plaintiff’s
expenses
(defined
in
Code
section
490.140)
23


if
the
court
determines
that
the
proceeding
has
resulted
in
24


substantial
benefit
to
the
corporation
and
alternatively
may
25


order
the
plaintiff
to
pay
the
defendant’s
expenses
if
it
26


finds
the
proceeding
was
commenced
without
reasonable
cause
27


or
for
an
improper
purpose
(Code
section
490.746).
The
bill
28


eliminates
the
court’s
statutory
authority
to
order
the
payment
29


of
attorney
fees.
30


PROCEEDINGS
——
COURT
APPOINTMENT
OF
A
CUSTODIAN
OR
RECEIVER.
31


The
bill
provides
that
a
shareholder
may
obtain
relief
from
a
32


court,
due
to
an
injury
suffered
by
the
corporation
due
to
the
33


action
or
inaction
of
the
board
(through
deadlock
or
fraud)
or
34


because

ELECTIONS
AND
VOTING.
The
bill
provides
for
the
directors’
3


terms
of
office
including
when
the
board’s
terms
are
staggered
4


(Code
sections
490.806
and
490.806A).
The
bill
provides
that
a
5


corporation’s
articles
of
incorporation
may
govern
situations
6


in
which
a
nominated
director
fails
to
receive
the
requisite
7


votes
for
election
(Code
sections
490.805,
490.806,
490.806A,
8


and
490.807).
The
bill
also
provides
that
in
the
case
of
a
9


director’s
vacancy,
where
a
director
was
elected
by
a
voting
10


group

shareholders,
and
the
vacancy
is
to
be
filled
by
the
11


remaining
directors,
only
directors
elected
by
that
voting
12


group
may
vote
to
fill
the
vacancy
(Code
section
490.810).
13


RIGHT
OF
SHAREHOLDERS
TO
VOTE.
The
bill
provides
that
a
14


corporation
may
agree
to
submit
a
matter
to
a
vote
of
its
15


shareholders
even
if
the
board
determines
not
to
recommend
16


the
matter
(Code
section
490.826).
It
expressly
authorizes
17


such
vote
on
an
amendment
to
the
corporation’s
articles
of
18


incorporation
(Code
section
490.1003),
an
action
on
a
plan
of
19


merger
or
share
exchange
(Code
section
490.1104),
the
approval
20


of
a
plan
of
merger
or
share
exchange
(Code
section
490.1106),
21


and
the
dissolution
of
the
corporation
(Code
section
490.1402).
22


DIRECTORS
AND
OFFICERS
——
STANDARDS
OF
CONDUCT.
A
director
23


must
perform
all
required
duties
in
good
faith
and
in
a
24


manner
that
the
director
reasonably
believes
to
be
in
the
25


corporation’s
best
interest
(Code
section
490.830)
and
an
26


officer
has
the
same
duty
to
act
in
good
faith
(Code
section
27


490.842).
The
bill
expressly
obligates
a
director
to
disclose
28


relevant
material
regarding
the
corporation
to
the
board.
It
29


also
provides
that
an
officer
has
an
obligation
to
inform
a
30


superior
officer
or
the
board
(or
a

A
DIRECTOR
FOR
EXPENSES.
A
corporation
may
advance
funds
to
a
1


director
or
indemnify
the
director
for
legal
expenses
incurred
2


in
the
course
of
a
director’s
defense
of
an
act
or
omission
3


(Code
sections
490.850,
490.853,
490.855,
and
490.858).
The
4


bill
provides
that
in
the
case
of
advances,
writings
required
5


to
be
submitted
to
the
board
(e.g.,
an
affirmation
that
the
6


director
acted
in
compliance
with
applicable
standards
of
7


conduct
or
a
promise
to
repay
advanced
funds)
must
be
in
8


writing
(Code
section
490.853).
It
also
provides
that
when

the
board
authorizes
an

or
indemnification,
the
voting
10


directors
must
be
qualified
rather
than
disinterested
(Code
11


sections
490.853
and
490.854).
Finally,
the
bill
provides
that
12


the
defending
director’s
right
to
an
advance
or
indemnification
13


in
effect
prior
to
the
director’s
act
or
omission
cannot
be
14


eliminated
or
impaired
after
the
conduct
occurred,
unless
that
15


right
was
expressly
qualified
in
the
authorization
(i.e.,
in
16


the
articles
of
incorporation,
bylaws,
or
board’s
resolution)
17


(Code
section
490.858).
18


DIRECTOR’S
CONFLICT
OF
INTEREST
——
GENERAL.
Generally,
a
19


director
is
prohibited
from
taking
action
on
a
matter
which
20


would
be
detrimental
to
the
interests
of
the
corporation.
The
21


bill
replaces
the
current
provision
addressing
a
director’s
22


conflict
of
interest
(Code
section
490.832)
with
four
23


provisions
(Code
sections
490.860
through
490.863)
that
24


govern
conflicting
interest
transactions.
In
order
to
be
so
25


classified,
a
transaction
must
be
effectuated
or
proposed
to
26


be
effectuated
by
the
corporation
or
an
entity
controlled
27


by
the
corporation.
In
addition,
the
director
must
be
in
a
28


special
position
to
take
personal
advantage
of
the
transaction,
29


as
a
party
to
the
transaction
or
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
30


the
director,
or
a
related
person,
has
a
material
financial
31


interest
in
the
transaction.
The
bill
provides
that
a
director
32


is
related
to
a
person
if
the
person
is
a
close
family
member,
33


an
individual
who
lives
in
the
same
home,
or
another
entity
34


controlled
by
the
director.
The
bill
provides
that

order
35


-64-


LSB

for
a
court
to
invalidate
a
transaction
or
otherwise
provide
a
1


legal
or
equitable
remedy,
such
conduct
must
fall
within
the
2


statutory
parameters
(Code
section
490.861).
The
definition
3


of
“director’s
conflicting
interest
transaction”
requires
4


knowledge
of
the
transaction,
except
where
the
director
is
a
5


party.
In
addition,
the
transaction
must
occur
at
a
relevant
6


time,
meaning
the
time
at
the
which
the
director’s
action
is
7


required
(e.g.,
a
board
vote)
or
when
the
director’s
action
8


somehow
consummates
the
transaction
(Code
section
490.862).
9


DIRECTOR’S
CONFLICT
OF
INTEREST
——
EXCUSED
TRANSACTIONS
10


(SAFE
HARBOR
EXCEPTION).
The
bill
excuses
a
director’s
11


conduct,
and
consequently
validates
the
transaction,
even
if
12


there
exists
a
conflicting
interest
transaction
(Code
section
13


490.861),
sometimes
referred
to
as
“safe
harbor”,
in
certain
14


circumstances.
First,
it
may
be
excused
if
a
majority
of
15


qualified
directors
(but
not
less
than
two)
vote
to
approve
16


the
transaction
or
the
action
is
approved
by
an
authorized
17


committee
in
which
all
members
are
qualified
directors
(Code
18


section
490.862).
The
director
who
has
the
conflict
must
19


disclose
information
regarding
the
conflict
to
the
extent
that
20


the
information
is
not
required
to
be
protected
under
law
or
21


some
ethical
rule
of
confidentiality
(Code
section
490.862).
22


The
transaction
is
excused
if
the
shareholders
later
ratify
23


the
transaction
according
to
specific
procedural
requirements
24


(Code
section
490.863)
after
disclosure
(but
no
provision
for
25


limited
disclosure).
Finally,
the
transaction
is
excused
if
26


the
transaction
is
fair
to
the
corporation,
although
neither
27


directors’
nor
shareholders’
action
was
taken.
The
bill
28


provides
that
in
any
legal
action
attacking
a
director,
the
29


plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proof
(Code
section
490.831).
30


DIRECTOR’S
BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITY
(SAFE
HARBOR
EXCEPTION).
31


An
analogous
situation
to
a
conflicting
interest
transaction
32


is
when
a
director
seeks
a
corporation’s
permission
prior
to
33


the
director’s
action.
The
bill
allows
qualified
directors
34


or
shareholders
to
disclaim
the
corporation’s
interest
before
35


-65-


LSB
5446HV
(2)
84


da/nh
65/
70



H.F.
2426


the
director
proceeds
in
taking
advantage
of
the
business
1


opportunity
(see
Code
section
490.870).
Instead
of
making
a
2


“required
disclosure”
as
provided
for
conflicts
(Code
sections
3


490.860
and
490.862),
the
director
must
provide
the
corporation
4


material
facts
concerning
the
business
opportunity
then
5


known.
The
qualified
directors
or
shareholders
disclaiming
6


the
corporation’s
interest
must
be
done
in
the
same
manner
7


as
if
the
matter
concerned
a
director’s
conflicting
interest
8


transaction
(Code
sections
490.862
and
490.863).
However,
a
9


director’s
decision
not
to
use
the
procedures
for
disclaimer
10


does
not
create
a
negative
inference
or
alter
a
burden
of
11


proof
in
a
subsequent
action
alleging
an
improper
taking
of
a
12


corporate
opportunity.
13


SHAREHOLDER
APPRAISAL
RIGHTS
——
GENERAL
RULE.
A
number
of
14


corporate
actions
may
trigger
the
right
of
a
shareholder
to
15


obtain
an
appraisal
of
the
corporation
and
obtain
fair
payment
16


of
shares,
including
mergers,
share
exchanges,
disposition
17


of
assets,
amendments
to
the
articles
of
incorporation,
and
18


conversion
of
the
corporation
to
another
entity
(Code
section
19


490.1302).
A
corporation
must
pay
shareholders
the
amount
the
20

SHAREHOLDER
APPRAISAL
RIGHTS
——
LIMITATION
ON
THE
GENERAL
23


RULE
(MARKET-OUT
EXCEPTION).
The
general
rule
is
limited
in
24


the
case
where
there
are
at
least
2,000
shareholders
and
the
25


market
value
of
the
shares
equals
at
least
$20
million
(the
26


so-called
“market-out”
exception),
presumably
because
the
true
27


value
for
the
shares
can
be
obtained
on
the
market.
However,
28


the
amount
does
not
include
shares
held
by
the
corporation’s
29


subsidiaries,
senior
executives,
directors,
and
beneficial
30


shareholders
owning
more
than
10
percent
of
the
shares.
31


“Beneficial
ownership”
refers
to
the
control
of
shares
by
a
32


person
who
does
not
own
them
including
the
power
to
vote,
or
to
33


direct
the
voting
of
the
shares
(Code
section
490.1302).

The
bill
provides
two
new
categories
under
the
market-out
1


exception:
(1)
when
the
shares
are
classified
as
a
covered
2


security
regulated
by
the
United
States
securities
exchange
3


commission
under
the
federal
Securities
Act
of
1933,
and
(2)
4


when
the
shares
are
issued
by
an
open-end
management
investment
5


company
registered
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
6


under
the
federal
Investment
Company

of

(Code
section

8


SHAREHOLDER
APPRAISAL
RIGHTS
——
LIMITATIONS
ON
THE
9


MARKET-OUT
EXCEPTIONS.
The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
10


which
allows
shareholder
appraisal
rights
notwithstanding
11


the
market-out
exception
in
cases
where
the
corporation’s
12


shares
or
assets
are
being
acquired
or
converted,
whether
by
13


merger,
share
exchange,
or
otherwise
(Code
section
490.1302).
14


Instead,
the
bill
allows
such
rights
in
cases
where
the
15


corporate
action
involves
an
interested
transaction,
which
is
a
16


corporate
action,
other
than
a
merger,
involving
an
interested
17


person
in
which
the
shares
or
assets
of
the
corporation
are
18


being
acquired
or
converted.
A
person
is
“interested”
if
19


the
person
is
a
beneficial
owner
of
20
percent
or
more
of
20


the
corporation’s
voting
shares,
controlled
the
appointment
21


or
election
of
25
percent
or
more
of
the
directors,
or
was
a
22


senior
executive
or
director
of
the
corporation
entitled
to
23


receive
certain
financial
benefits
(Code
section
490.1301).
24


SHAREHOLDER
APPRAISAL
RIGHTS
——
NOTICE.
A
corporation
must
25


notify
shareholders
of
their
appraisal
rights
when
a
corporate
26


action
is
submitted
to
a
vote
at
a
shareholder
meeting
(Code
27


section
490.1320).
The
bill
provides
for
notice
when
approval
28


is
performed
by
written
consent
in
lieu
of
a
meeting
(Code
29


section
490.704).
A
shareholder
must
provide
notice
of
an
30


intent
to
exercise
appraisal
rights
before
the
corporate
action
31


(vote)
is
taken
(Code
section
490.1321).
In
order
to
remain
32


eligible
to
exercise
those
rights,
the
shareholder
must
not
33


vote
on
the
matter.
A
shareholder
who
plans
on
asserting
34


appraisal
rights
cannot
likewise
exercise
rights
after
signing
35

H.F.

a
consent
in
favor
of
the
proposal
(Code
section
490.1321).
1


If
a
corporate
action
requiring
appraisal
rights
becomes
2


effective,
the
corporation
must
deliver
a
written
appraisal
3


notice
and
form
(Code
section
490.1322).
The
bill
provides
for
4


the
contents
of
the
notice,
including
information
regarding
5


an
announcement
to
shareholders
made
prior
to
the
date
the
6


corporate
action
became
effective
and
requires
a
shareholder
7


asserting
appraisal
rights
to
certify
beneficial
ownership.
8


The
bill
provides
for
perfecting
shareholder
appraisal
rights
9


by
signing
and
returning
the
form
(Code
section
490.1323).
The
10


bill
provides
an
estimated
(prepaid)
payment
to
shareholders
11


exercising
their
appraisal
rights
after
the
form’s
due
date
12


(Code
section
490.1324).
The
bill
provides
for
a
financial
13


statement
required
to
accompany
the
payment
(Code
section
14


490.1620),
and
allows
the
corporation
to
substitute
another
15


document
in
lieu
of
a
financial
statement
if
it
is
unavailable.
16


SHAREHOLDER
APPRAISAL
RIGHTS
——
COURT
COSTS.
As
part
of
17


a
shareholder
appraisal
rights
proceeding,
the
court
must
18


determine
the
court
costs
of
the
proceeding,
and
may
assess
19


such
costs
against
the
corporation
or
shareholders
demanding
20


appraisal
(Code
section
490.1331).
The
bill
amends
the
21


provision
to
eliminate
a
court’s
discretion
to
assess
fees
22


associated
with
attorneys
and
experts.
23


SHAREHOLDER
RIGHTS
——
LIMITATION
ON
OTHER
REMEDIES.
The
24


bill
provides
that
a
corporate
action
triggering
a
right
to
25


appraisal
(Code
section
490.1302)
cannot
be
enjoined,
set
26


aside,
or
rescinded
by
a
shareholder
after
the
shareholder
27


has
approved
the
corporate
action
(Code
section
490.1340).
28


However,
this
limitation
does
not
apply
to
four
situations:
29


(1)
where
the
process
of
approving
the
corporate
action
was
30


flawed
(e.g.,
unauthorized
in
the
corporation’s
articles
of
31


incorporation),
(2)
the
corporate
action
was
procured
by
fraud,
32


(3)
the
corporate
action
was
an
interested
transaction
in
the
33


same
manner
as
a
director’s
conflicting
interest
transaction
34


(Code
section
490.860),
or
(4)
the
transaction
was
approved,
35

but
without
a
meeting
(Code
section
490.704)
and
by
less
1


than
unanimous
consent
and
the
challenge
is
brought
by
a
2


nonconsenting
director.
3


JUDICIAL
DISSOLUTION
——
LIMITATION
ON
ACTIONS.
A
court
may
4


dissolve
a
corporation
in
a
proceeding
brought
by
shareholders
5


on
a
number
of
grounds,
including
the
directors
are
deadlocked,
6


the
directors
are
acting
fraudulently,
the
shareholders
7


are
deadlocked,
or
there
is
waste
of
corporate
assets
(Code
8


section
490.1430).
The
bill
adds
a
new
ground,
that
the
9


corporation
has
abandoned
its
business
and
failed
to
liquidate
10


and
distribute
its
assets
and
dissolve.
The
bill
also
11


provides
that
the
right
of
a
shareholder
to
bring
the
action
12


does
not
apply
to
a
corporation
listed
on
the
New
York
stock
13


exchange,
the
American
stock
exchange,
an
exchange
owned
or
14


controlled
by
NASDAQ,
or
listed
on
a
system
owned
or
controlled
15


by
the
national
association
of
security
dealers
(NASD).
16


Alternatively,
it
does
not
apply
to
a
corporation
having
300
17


or
more
shareholders
holding
shares
valued
at
$20
million
18


or
more,
again
excluding
shares
held
by
the
corporation’s
19


subsidiaries,
senior
executives,
directors,
and
beneficial
20


shareholders
owning
more
than
10
percent
of
the
shares
(Code
21


section
490.1302).
22


FOREIGN
CORPORATIONS
——
TRANSFER
OF
AUTHORITY.
The
bill
23


provides
for
the
conversion
of
a
foreign
business
corporation
24


authorized
to
do
business
in
this
state
into
a
domestic
25


corporation
by
applying
to
the
secretary
of
state
(Code
section
26


490.1523).
27


REPLACEMENT
OF
FUTURE
REPEALED
PROVISIONS.
In
2011,
the
28


general
assembly
enacted
SF
325
(2011
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
29


2),
carving
out
a
special
provision
which
provided
for
the
30


staggered
terms
of
directors
of
public
corporations
and
31


providing
for
the
repeal
of
the
Act
on
December
31,
2014.
This
32


bill
amends
one
of
those
provisions,
Code
section
490.805,
33


subsection
2,
and
consequently
the
bill
provides
that
the
34


provision
of
this
Act
amending
that

section
prevails
