BY
BOLKCOM


A
Concurrent
Resolution
urging
the
United
States
1


Congress
to
modernize
the
Toxic
Substances
Control
2


Act
of
1976.
3


WHEREAS,
children
and
developing
fetuses
are
4


uniquely
vulnerable
to
the
health
threats
of
toxic
5


chemicals
and
early-life
chemical
exposures
have
been
6


linked
to
chronic
disease
later
in
life;
and
7


WHEREAS,
a
growing
body
of
peer-reviewed
scientific
8


evidence
links
exposure
to
toxic
chemicals
to
many
9


diseases
and
health
conditions
that
are
rising
in
10


incidence,
including
childhood
cancers,
prostate
11


cancer,
breast
cancer,
learning
and
developmental
12


disabilities,
infertility,
and
obesity;
and
13


WHEREAS,
the
President’s
Cancer
Panel
report
14


released
in
May
2010
stated
“the
true
burden
of
15


environmentally
induced
cancers
has
been
grossly
16


underestimated”
and
advised
the
President
“to
use
17


the
power
of
your
office
to
remove
the
carcinogens
18


and
other
toxins
from
our
food,
water,
and
air
that
19


needlessly
increase
health
care
costs,
cripple
20


our
nation’s
productivity,
and
devastate
American
21


lives”;
and
22


WHEREAS,
states
bear
an
undue
burden
from
23


toxic
chemicals,
including
health
care
costs
and
24


environmental
damages,
disadvantaging
businesses
that
25


lack
information
on
chemicals
in
their
supply
chain
and
26


increasing
demands
for
state
regulation;
and
27


WHEREAS,

Substances
Control
Act

S.C.R.

of
1976
(TSCA)
was
passed,
about
62,000
chemicals
1


in
commerce
were
grandfathered
in
without
any
2


required
testing
for
health
and
safety
hazards
or
any
3


restrictions
on
usage;
and
4


WHEREAS,
in
the
35
years
since
the
TSCA
was
passed,
5


the
United
States
Environmental
Protection
Agency
(EPA)
6


has
required
chemical
companies
to
test
only
about
200
7


of
those
chemicals
for
health
hazards
and
has
issued
8


partial
restrictions
on
only
five
chemicals;
and
9


WHEREAS,
the
TSCA
has
been
widely
recognized
as
10


ineffective
and
obsolete
due
to
legal
and
procedural
11


hurdles
that
prevent
the
EPA
from
taking
quick
and
12


effective
regulatory
action
to
protect
the
public
13


against
well-known
chemical
threats;
and
14


WHEREAS,
the
National
Conference
of
State
15


Legislatures
unanimously
adopted
a
resolution
on
July
16


12,
2009,
that
articulated
principles
for
TSCA
reform
17


and
called
on
Congress
to
act
to
update
the
law;
and
18


WHEREAS,
the
TSCA
is
the
only
major
federal
19


environmental
statute
that
has
never
been
updated
or
20


reauthorized;
and
21


WHEREAS,
legislation
to
substantially
reform
the
22


TSCA
was
introduced
during
the
109th
Congress
in
2005,
23


the
110th
Congress
in
2008,
and
again
in
the
111th
24


Congress
in
2010;
NOW
THEREFORE,
25


BE
IT
RESOLVED
BY
THE
SENATE,
THE
HOUSE
OF

CONCURRING,
That
the
Iowa
General
27


Assembly
encourages
the
112th
Congress
to
enact

BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
the
policy
reforms
1


should
require
chemical
manufacturers
to
prove
2


that
all
existing
and
new
chemicals
are
not
harmful
3


to
human
health,
and
provide
essential
health
and
4


safety
information
on
chemicals
to
inform
the
market,
5


consumers,
and
general
public;
and
6


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
the
policy
reforms
7


should
require
immediate
action
to
reduce
or
8


eliminate
the
worst
chemicals,
including
persistent,
9


bioaccumulative,
and
toxic
chemicals
and
other
10


priority
toxics
to
which
there
is
already
widespread
11


exposure;
and
12


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
the
policy
reforms
13


should
preserve
the
authority
of
state
and
tribal
14


governments
to
operate
chemicals
management
programs
15


that
are
more
protective
than
the
federal
programs;
and
16


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
the
policy
reforms
17


should
establish
health
safety
standards
for
chemicals
18


that
rely
on
the
best
available
science
to
protect
19


the
most
vulnerable
among
us,
such
as
children
and
20


developing
fetuses;
and
21


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
the
policy
reforms
22


should
reward
innovation
by
fast
tracking
approval
of
23


new,
demonstratively
safer
chemicals,
and
invest
in
24


green
chemistry
research
and
workforce
development
to
25


boost
American
business
and
spur
jobs
making
safer
26


alternatives;
and
27


BE
IT
FURTHER
RESOLVED,
That
the
policy
reforms
