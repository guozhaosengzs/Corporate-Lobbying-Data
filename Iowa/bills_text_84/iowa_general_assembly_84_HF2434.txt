Ongoing

1.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
a
regular
review
of
24


the
programs
and
projects
administered
by
state
government
is
25


necessary
to
determine
whether
each
program
and
project
is
26


effectively
and
efficiently
meeting
the
needs
for
which
created
27


and
whether
the
needs
remain
applicable.
The
general
assembly
28


further
finds
that
a
regular,
systematic
review
process
can
29


identify
the
programs
and
projects
that
are
no
longer
relevant
30


or
functioning
at
a
desirable
level
and
can
eliminate
or
31


reorganize
those
programs
and
projects
so
that
state
resources
32


can
be
used
most
effectively
or
diverted
to
other
priorities.
