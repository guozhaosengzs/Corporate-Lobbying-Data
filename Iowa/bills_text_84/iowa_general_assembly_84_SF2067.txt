The
5


bill
provides
that
the
nurse
staffing
plan
provisions
should
6


not
be
construed
as
a
prohibition
on
the

to

set

than

under

the

The

The

assigned
to
a

A
hospital
cannot
encroach

registered
18


nurse’s
scope
of
practice
or
require
a
direct

registered
19


nurse
to
train
a
replacement
if
doing
so
would
jeopardize
20


patient
safety.
A
hospital
must
establish
a
system
to
document
21


staffing
in
each
unit
for
each
shift.
A
hospital
shall
22


approve
updates
to
the

hospital
may
not
discipline
a

faith
and
within
the

judgment
that
the
