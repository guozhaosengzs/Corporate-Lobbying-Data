EXPLANATION
25


BACKGROUND.
Code
section
165.18
creates
a
brucellosis
and
26


tuberculosis
eradication
fund
administered
by
the
department
of
27


agriculture
and
land
stewardship.
The
fund
is
used
to
support
28


costs
incurred
by
the
department
when
administering
programs
29


to
control
those
diseases
affecting
cattle
as
provided
in
30


Code
chapters
164
and
165.
Moneys
in
the
fund
derive
from
a
31


property
tax
levied
by
counties.
The
tax
is
levied
by
county
32


boards
of
supervisors
after
the
secretary
of
agriculture
33


notifies
them
of
the
taxable
amount
(a
maximum
levy
of
33
and
34


3/4
cents
per
$1,000
of
assessed
value
of
all
taxable
property

county).

CHANGES.
This
bill
replaces
how
the
fund
is
financed
by
2


eliminating
the
county
property
tax
levy.
Instead,
the
bill
3


allows
the
executive
council
to
approve
a
request
by
the
4


secretary
of
agriculture
for
a
payment
amount
not
to
exceed
5


$500,000
(Code
section
7D.10A).
The
executive
council
is
6


required
to
notify
the
legislative
services
agency
before
it
7


meets
to
consider
the
secretary’s
request.
The
request
is
8


paid
by
the
executive
council
from
appropriations
available
9


to
it
from
the
general
fund
of
the
state
as
an
authorized
10


expense
(Code
section
7D.29).
The
bill
also
references
other
11


authorized
expenditures
already
provided
for
in
the
Code.
