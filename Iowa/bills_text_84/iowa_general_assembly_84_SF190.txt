This
chapter
shall

Findings
and
purpose.

1.
Findings.
The
general
assembly
finds
all
of
the
5


following:
6


a.
Hearing
loss
affects
the
most
basic
human
need
of
7


communication.
Without
quality
communication,
a
child
is
8


isolated
from
other
human
beings
and
from
the
exchange
of
9


knowledge
essential
for
educational
growth,
both
planned
and
10


incidental,
and,
therefore,
cannot
fully
develop
the
academic,
11


social,
and
emotional
skills
required
to
become
a
productive,
12


capable
adult,
and
a
full
participatory
member
of
society.
13


b.
Children
with
hearing
loss
have
the
same
innate
14


capabilities
as
any
other
children.
They
may
communicate
in
a
15


wide
variety
of
manual
and
spoken
modes
or
systems
of
English.
16


Some
use
aural/oral
modes
of
communication,
while
others
use
a
17


combination
of
aural/oral
and
manual
modes
of
communication.
18


Many
use
American
sign
language.
19


c.
Therefore,
it
is
critical
that
all
Iowans
work
toward
20


ensuring
that
all
of
the
following
will
occur:
21


(1)
Parents
or
guardians
have
full
and
informed
22


participation
in
their
children’s
educational
planning.
23


(2)
Families
of
children
who
are
deaf
or
hard-of-hearing
24


receive
accurate,
balanced,
and
complete
information
regarding
25


their
child’s
educational
and
communication
needs.
26


(3)
Parents
or
guardians
have
information
on
all
available
27


programmatic,
placement,
and
resource
options,
including
28


special
school
participation.
29


(4)
Families
of
children
who
are
deaf
or
hard-of-hearing
30


have
access
to
support
services
and
advocacy
resources
from
31


public
and
private
agencies
and
all
other
institutions
and
32


resources
knowledgeable
about
hearing
loss
and
the
needs
of
33


children
who
are
deaf
or
hard-of-hearing.
34


(5)
Deaf
and
hard-of-hearing
children,
like
all
children,

have
direct,

and
fluid
communication,
both
in

and

of
the
classroom.
2


(6)
Deaf
and
hard-of-hearing
children
are
placed
in
3


the
least
restrictive
educational
environment.
For
deaf
4


and
hard-of-hearing
children
that
environment
should
be
5


an
accessible,
language
rich
environment,
and
services
6


are
provided
based
on
the
children’s
unique
communication,
7


language,
and
educational
needs,
consistent
with
20
U.S.C.
§
8


1414(d)(3)(B)(iv)
of
the
federal
Individuals
with

9

10


(7)
Deaf
and
hard-of-hearing
children
are
given
an
11


education
in
which
they
have
access
to
teachers,
related
12


service
providers,
and
evaluators
who
understand
the
unique
13


nature
of
deafness,
and
are
specifically
trained
to
work
14


with
hard-of-hearing
and
deaf
pupils
and
can
communicate
15


spontaneously
and
fluidly
with
these
children.
16


(8)
Deaf
and
hard-of-hearing
children,
like
all
children,
17


have
the
benefit
of
an
education
in
which
there
are
a
18


sufficient
number
of
age-appropriate
peers
and
adults
with
whom
19


they
can
interact
and
communicate
directly
or,
as
appropriate,
20


through
the
use
of
qualified
and
licensed
interpreters.
21


(9)
Deaf
and
hard-of-hearing
children
can
receive
an
22


education
in
which
they
are
exposed
to
and
interact
with
deaf
23


and
hard-of-hearing
role
models.
24


(10)
Deaf
and
hard-of-hearing
children,
like
all
children,
25


have
direct
and
appropriate
communication
access
to
all
typical
26


components
of
the
educational
process,
including
recess,
lunch,
27


and
extracurricular,
social,
and
athletic
activities.
28


(11)
Deaf
and
hard-of-hearing
children,
like
all
children,
29


are
provided
with
programs
in
which
transition
planning,
as
30


required
under
the
federal
Individuals
with
Disabilities
31


Education
Act,
focuses
on
their
unique
vocational
and
academic
32


needs.
33


(12)
Deaf
and
hard-of-hearing
children
have
the
right
to
34


early
intervention
to
facilitate
the
acquisition
of
