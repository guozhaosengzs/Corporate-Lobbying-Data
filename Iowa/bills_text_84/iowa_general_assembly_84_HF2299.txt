EXPLANATION
2


Currently,
Code
section

provides
that
the
effective
3


date
of
a
driver’s
license
held
by
a
person
at
the
time
of
4


entering
the
military
service
of
the
United
States
or
of
5


the
state
of
Iowa
is
extended
without
fee
until
six
months
6


following
the
person’s
initial
separation
from
active
duty.
7


The
person
is
required
to
furnish,
upon
demand
of
any
peace
8


officer,
satisfactory
evidence
of
the
person’s
military
9


service.
If
the
person
is
charged
with
driving
without
a
10


valid
driver’s
license,
the
person
may
avoid
conviction
by
11


producing
in
court,
within
a
reasonable
time,
the
driver’s
12


license
previously
issued
to
the
person
along
with
evidence
of
13


the
person’s
military
service.
Form
430028,
available
from
the
14


department
of
transportation,
explains
the
statutory
provisions
15


regarding
military
extensions.
Pursuant
to
administrative
16


rule,
the
department
recommends
that
a
person
who
qualifies
for
17


the
military
extension
should
request
the
form
and
carry
it
18


with
the
person’s
driver’s
license
for
verification
to
peace
19


officers.
20


This
bill
amends
Code
section
321.198
to
specify
that
21


a
person’s
department
of
defense
common
access
card
is
22


satisfactory
evidence
of
current
military
service,
and
a
23


certificate
of
release
or
discharge
from
active
duty,
known
24


as
a
DD214,
is
satisfactory
evidence
of
a
person’s
previous
25


military
service
and
discharge
from
active
duty.
The
bill
26


provides
that
a
person
who
produces
either
a
common
access
card
27


or
DD214,
along
with
the
driver’s
license
previously
issued
to
28


the
person,
shall
not
be
required
to
produce
any
additional
29


documentation
to
a
peace
officer
or
to
a
court
in
order
to
30


satisfy
the
requirements
for
a
military
extension.
