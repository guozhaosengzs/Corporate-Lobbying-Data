work
which
furthers
a

other

or
the
interests
of
a
profession,

trade,
business,
or
other
class

avoided.
In
making
a
decision
relative
to
a
member’s
7


activity
on
particular
bills
or
in
committee
work,
the
8


following
factors
should
be
considered:
9


a.
Whether
a
substantial
threat
to
the
member’s
10


independence
of
judgment
has
been
created
by
the
11


conflict
situation.
12


b.
The
effect

participation
on
13


public
confidence

the
integrity

c.
Whether
the

participation
is
likely
to
16


have
any
significant
effect
on
the
disposition
of
the
17


matter.
18


d.
The
need
for
the
member’s
particular
19


contribution,
such
as
special
knowledge
of
the
subject
20


matter,
to
the
effective
functioning
of
the
general
21


assembly.
22


If
a
member
decides
not
to
participate
in
committee
23


work
or
to
abstain
from
voting
because
of
a
possible
24


conflict
of
interest,
the
member
should
disclose
25


this
fact
to
the
legislative
body.
The
member
shall
26


not
vote
on
any
question
in
which
the
member
has
an
27


economic
interest
that
is
distinguishable
from
the
28


interests
of
the
general
public
or
a
substantial
class
29


of
