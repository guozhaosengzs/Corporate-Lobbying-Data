EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


Under
current
law,
Code
section
321.276
prohibits
the
use
4


of
hand-held
electronic
communication
devices
to
write,
send,
5


or
view
electronic
messages
while
driving
a
motor
vehicle.
6


This
bill
expands
Code
section
321.276
to
prohibit
any
use
7


of
an
electronic
communication
device
while
driving.
The
8


bill
defines
the
terms
“electronic
communication
device”
and
9


“electronic
message”.
10


The
bill
exempts
the
use
of
an
electronic
communication
11


device
in
a
hands-free
mode,
for
members
of
a
public
12


safety
agency
performing
official
duties,
for
health
care
13


professionals
in
the
course
of
emergency
situations,
for
the
14


purpose
of
reporting
an
emergency
situation,
or
by
pressing
a
15


single
button
to
initiate
or
terminate
a
voice
communication.
16


The
bill
makes
a
violation
of
Code
section
321.276
a
moving
17


violation.
Under
current
law,
a
moving
violation
can
be
18


considered
for
purposes
of
administrative
suspension
of
a
19


driver’s
license
or
to
establish
habitual
offender
status.
20


The
scheduled
fine
for
a
violation
of
Code
section
321.276
21


remains
$30.
Under
Code
section
321.482A,
if
the
violation
22


causes
a
serious
injury,
a
court
could
impose
an
additional
23


fine
of
$500
or
suspend
the
person’s
driver’s
license
for
not
24


more
than
90
days,
or
both.
If
the
violation
causes
a
death,
a
25


court
could
impose
an
additional
fine
of
$1,000
or
suspend
the
26


person’s
driver’s
license
for
not
more
than
180
days,
or
both.
27


The
bill
makes
corresponding
changes
to
Code
section
707.6A
28


(homicide
or
serious
injury
by
vehicle)
to
align
the
provisions
29


of
that
Code
section
related
to
the
use
of
an
electronic


30


communication
device
while
driving
to
the
provisions
of
Code
31


section
321.276
as
amended
by
the
bill.
