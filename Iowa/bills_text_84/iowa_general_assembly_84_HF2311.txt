This

exchange
of
the

stock
of
one
qualified
corporation.
19


Several
requirements
must
be
met
for
stock
to
qualify
as
20


capital
stock
of
a
qualified
corporation.
First,
the
stock
21


must
be
either
voting

nonvoting,
common
or
preferred
22


stock.
Stock
rights,
stock

23


securities

Second,
the
corporation
that
issued
24


the
stock
must
be
in
existence
and
actively
doing
business
in
25


Iowa
for
at
least
three
years.
A
corporation
that
is
part
of
an
26


affiliated
group
will
qualify
if
the
affiliated
group
includes
27


a
member
that
has
been
in
existence
and
actively
doing
business
28


in
Iowa
for
at
least
three
years.
Third,
the
corporation

issued
the

at
least
five
shareholders,

two
30


of
the
shareholders

Iowa
resident
on
account
of
employment
33


with
the

corporation.
A

to
a
reorganization

that
was
entirely
or
substantially
tax
free
as
long
as
the
1


reorganization
occurred
during
or
after
the
Iowa
resident’s
2


employment.
3


The
election
shall
apply
to
all
subsequent
extraordinary
4


dividends
and
sales
of
the
elected
capital
stock,
provided
5


it
is
capital
stock
in
the
same
qualified
corporation
and
6


was
acquired
on
account
of
employment
by
the
corporation
or
7


while
employed
by
the
corporation.
“Extraordinary
dividends”
8


are
defined
as
any
dividend
which
exceeds
20
percent
of
the
9


fair
market
value
of
the
stock
as
of
the
date
the
dividend
is
10


declared.
11


The
bill
provides
that
the
election
applies
to
transfers
12


of
the
capital
stock
by
inter
vivos
gift
from
the
electing
13


individual
to
a
spouse
or
lineal
descendant,
or
to
a
trust
for
14


the
benefit
of
the
taxpayer’s
spouse
or
lineal
descendant.
The
15


election
will
apply
to
a
spouse
only
if
the
spouse
was
married
16


to
the
electing
individual
on
the
date
of
the
extraordinary
17


dividend
or
sale
or
exchange
or
the
date
of
the
individual’s
18


death.
19


If,
after
making
a
valid
inter
vivos
transfer
of
stock
that
20


meets
all
the
requirements
for
an
election,
an
Iowa
resident
21


dies
without
making
an
election,
the
surviving
spouse,
or
if
22


there
is
no
surviving
spouse,
the
oldest
surviving
lineal
23


descendant
may
make
the
election.
24


An
election
is
made
by
including
a
written
statement
with
the
25


taxpayer’s
Iowa
income
tax
return
for
the
taxable
year
in
which
26


the
election
is
made.
The
written
statement
shall
identify
27


the
qualified
corporation
that
issued
the
capital
stock,
the
28


grounds
for
the
election,
a
statement
that
the
taxpayer
elects
29


to
have
the
exclusion
apply,
and
any
other
information
required
30


by
the
department
of
revenue.
The
department
of
revenue
is
31


required
to
provide
appropriate
forms
for
making
elections
and
32


reporting
exclusions.
33


The
