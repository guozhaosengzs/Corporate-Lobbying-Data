S.F.

Section
1.
NEW
SECTION
.
321.435
Motorcycles
equipped
with
1


detachable
stabilizing
wheels.
2


Notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
a
motor
vehicle
3


that
is
originally
designed
as
a
two-wheeled
motorcycle
and
4


is
modified
using
conversion
hardware
which
allows
for
the
5


attachment
and
detachment
of
two
stabilizing
rear
wheels
may
6


be
operated
on
a
highway
with
the
stabilizing
wheels
attached
7


in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
applicable
8


to
motorcycles.
A
motorcycle
shall
not
be
determined
to
be
9


reconstructed
based
on
the
sole
fact
that
two
stabilizing
10


wheels
have
been
added
as
described
in
this
section.
11


EXPLANATION
12


This
bill
authorizes
operation
of
motorcycles
equipped
with
13


detachable
stabilizing
wheels
on
the
rear
of
the
motorcycle.
14


The
additional
wheels
are
typically
installed
using
an
assembly
15


mounted
on
brackets
which
are
permanently
attached
to
the
frame
16


of
the
motorcycle.
The
assembly
containing
the
wheels
can
be
17


removed
from
the
brackets
to
convert
the
motorcycle
back
to
18


two-wheeled
operation.
19


Under
current
law,
the
term
“motorcycle”
is
defined
to
20


include
motor
vehicles
designed
to
travel
on
not
more
than
21


three
wheels.
The
bill
does
not
change
that
definition,
22


but
allows
a
motorcycle
designed
to
travel
on
two
wheels
23


but
equipped
with
detachable
stabilizing
rear
wheels
to
be
24


operated
on
Iowa
roads
as
a
motorcycle.
The
bill
states
that
a
25


motorcycle
is
not
considered
“reconstructed”
solely
because
of
26


the
addition
of
detachable
stabilizing
rear
wheels.
