days.
A

not

following
a
petition
for


21


reconsideration

22


EXPLANATION
23


This
bill
creates
a
review
process
when
the
board
of
24


veterinary
medicine
decides
not
to
investigate
a
veterinarian
25


after
receiving
a
written
complaint.
Currently,
animal
26


owners
have
no
recourse
with
the
board
when
it
decides
not
27


to
investigate.
Under
this
bill,
aggrieved
animal
owners
28


may
request
reconsideration
of
the
boardâ€™s
decision
not
to
29


investigate
a
veterinarian.
