Code

relating
to
enhanced
911
emergency

systems.

The
bill
modifies

chapter.
The
bill
provides

means

12


The
bill
provides
that
a
“communications
service
provider”
13


means
a
service
provider,
public
or
private,
that
transports
14


information
electronically
via
landline,

internet,
15

satellite.
The
bill
changes
references
to
the
16


wireless
communications
surcharge
contained
in
Code
section
17


34A.7A
to
an
“emergency
communications
service
surcharge”,
18


and
adds
a
definition
accordingly
which
references
that
Code
19


section.
20


The
bill
adds
a
definition
of
“wireless
communications
21


service”
to
mean
commercial
mobile
radio
service,
as
defined
22


under
specified
federal
legislation
and
rules,
including
any
23


wireless
two-way
communications
used
in
cellular
telephone
24


service,
personal
communications
service,
or
the
functional
or
25


competitive
equivalent
of
a
radio-telephone
communications

26


used

a
personal

to
32


mean
a
company
that
offers
commercial

bill
deletes
a
definition
of

2


currently
contained
in
Code
section
34A.7A,
subsection
5,
as
3


being

the
definitions
added
by

6


chapter.
7


The
bill
deletes
a
requirement
that
a
state
agency
having
8


a

cooperate
in

service
plan,
but
retains
that

11


with
reference
to

12


The
bill
adds
a
reference
to
“wire-line”
surcharges
with
13


respect
to
the
surcharge
contained
in
Code
section
34A.6,
to
14


clarify
that
it
applies
to
wire-line,
rather
than
wireless,
15


communications
and
to
promote
consistency
with
the
local
16


wire-line
E911
service
surcharge
imposed
pursuant
to
Code
17


section
34A.7.
The
bill
deletes
references
to
“telephone”
18


communications
systems
and
surcharges
contained
in
Code
section
19


34A.7,
in
favor
of
the
broader
“emergency”
communication
20


systems
and
surcharges.
21


The
bill
specifies
that
the
emergency
communication
services
22


surcharge
contained

Code
section
34A.7A
shall
not
be
imposed
23


on

26


providers
and
the
“wireless”
E911
emergency
communications
27


fund.
The
bill
increases
the
emergency
communications
service
28


surcharge
from
the
current
level
of
sixty-five
cents
per
month
29


to
one

which
30


currently
authorizes
an
alternative
wire-line
surcharge
of
up
31


to
$2.50

for
