A
BILL
FOR


An
Act
relating
to
reforming
state
and
county
responsibilities
1


for
mental
health
and
disabilities
services,
making
2


appropriations,
and
including
effective
date
provisions.

BE
IT
ENACTED
BY
THE
GENERAL
ASSEMBLY
OF
THE
STATE
OF
IOWA:

S.F.

Section
1.
REFORM
OF
MENTAL
HEALTH
AND
DISABILITY
SERVICES
1


——
FINDINGS,
PURPOSE,
AND
PLANNING
PROVISIONS.
2


1.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
full
implementation
3


of
the
federal
Patient
Protection
and
Affordable
Care
Act,
4


Pub.
L.
No.
111-148,
in
2014
will
have
a
significant
impact
5


on
services
to
low-income
Iowans
because
eligibility
for
the
6


Medicaid
program
will
be
simplified
to
include
individuals
7


having
an
income
at
or
below
133
percent
of
the
federal
8


poverty
level.
Consequently,
the
additional
categorical
9


eligibility
requirements
now
applicable
for
Medicaid
program
10


eligibility,
such
as
being
a
recipient
of
federal
supplemental
11


security
income
(SSI)
or
for
meeting
Medicaid
program
waiver
12


requirements,
will
no
longer
apply.
Because
Medicaid
is
such
13


a
significant
funding
source
for
Iowa’s
mental
health
system
14


for
children
and
adults,
the
simplified
eligibility
change
15


presents
an
opportunity
to
reform
that
system.
The
simplified
16


Medicaid
eligibility
provisions
coming
into
force
in
2014
also
17


will
provide
Medicaid
eligibility
to
many
adults
whose
services
18


costs
are
wholly
or
primarily
a
county
responsibility.
19


2.
Under
current
law,
counties
pay
the
nonfederal
share
20


of
the
costs
of
Medicaid
program
services
provided
to
address
21


the
needs
of
eligible
adults
with
mental
illness.
Because
the
22


increases
in
overall
funding
for
such
services
have
experienced
23


very
limited
growth
in
recent
years,
the
annual
increases
24


needed
to
fund
the
county
Medicaid
responsibility
have
been
25


reducing
the
funding
counties
have
available
to
fund
other
26


non-Medicaid
services.
With
the
federal
expansion
in
those
27


eligible
for
the
Medicaid
program,
significant
new
funding
will
28


be
needed
to
provide
the
match
for
the
new
eligible
adults.
29


3.
It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
incrementally
30


shift
responsibility
for
the
funding
of
services
for
adults
31


with
mental
illness
from
the
counties
to
the
state
so
that
32


the
shift
is
completed
by
2014
when
the
new
federal
law
takes
33


effect.
34


4.
Among
adults
who
have
a
serious
mental
illness,
the
35


-1-

incidence
of
those
with
a
co-occurring
disorder
involving
abuse
1


of
alcohol
or
another
substance
is
much
higher
than
among
the
2


population
without
such
an
illness.
However,
the
availability
3


of
treatment
that
simultaneously
addresses
both
disorders
is
4


very
limited.
5


5.
a.
Under
current
law,
if
an
adult
has
a
serious
mental
6


illness
and
does
not
have
a
means
of
paying
for
services,
the
7


primary
responsibility
to
fund
and
make
the
services
available
8


is
assigned
to
counties.
Although
many
common
elements
do
9


exist
among
the
service
arrays
offered
by
counties,
a
basic
set
10


of
services
is
not
available
in
all
counties,
waiting
lists
for
11


some
services
are
in
effect
in
some
counties,
the
availability
12


of
community-based
services
in
some
counties
is
very
limited,
13


and
other
disparities
exist.
14


b.
It
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
to
address
such
15


disparity
by
shifting
the
payment
responsibility
for
adult
16


mental
illness
services
from
the
counties
to
the
state
and
17


developing
a
regional
approach
to
provide
system
access
and
18


navigation
and
care
coordination
functions.
19


6.
Counties
are
limited
to
levying
approximately
$125
20


million
in
property
taxes
statewide
for
the
services
due
to
law
21


enacted
in
the
mid-1990s.
The
state
distributes
to
counties
22


approximately
$89
million
to
replace
equivalent
reductions
23


in
the
amount
of
property
taxes
raised
for
this
purpose.
In
24


addition,
for
fiscal
year
2010-2011,
the
state
will
distribute
25


to
counties
approximately
$49
million
in
allowed
growth
funds,
26


approximately
$14
million
in
community
services
funds,
and
27


approximately
$11
million
to
reimburse
for
state
cases.
28


7.
Beginning
on
the
effective
date
of
this
section
and
29


continuing
through
the
fiscal
year
beginning
July
1,
2011,
the
30


department
of
human
services
shall
consult
with
stakeholders
in
31


developing
a
plan
and
implementation
provisions
for
a
system
32


for
adults
in
need
of
publicly
funded
mental
health
services
33


and
related
support,
proposing
but
not
limited
to
