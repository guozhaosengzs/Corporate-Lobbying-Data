EXPLANATION
22


GENERAL.
This
bill
provides
for
the
promotion
of
biodiesel
23


used
in
the
manufacture
of
motor
fuel
which
is
a
blend
of
24


diesel
fuel
and
biodiesel
(biodiesel
blended
fuel).
Biodiesel
25


fuel
is
designated
B-xx
where
“xx”
is
the
volume
percent
of
26


biodiesel
(Code
section
214A.2).
For
example,
all
biodiesel
27


blended
fuel
must
be
classified
as
B-1
or
higher,
meaning
at
28


least
1
percent
of
biodiesel
blended
fuel
by
volume
must
be
29


biodiesel.
The
provisions
of
the
bill
are
administered
by
the
30


department
of
revenue.
31


The
bill
includes
two
divisions.
First,
the
bill
amends
32


current
provisions
which
establish
a
biodiesel
blended
fuel
33


tax
credit
for
retail
dealers,
and
second,
the
bill
provides
34


payments
to
biodiesel
producers.

DIVISION
I
——
BIODIESEL
BLENDED
FUEL
TAX
CREDIT.
Under
1


current
law
a
retail
dealer
who
sells
and
dispenses
diesel
fuel
2


from
a
motor
fuel
pump
is
eligible
for
a
biodiesel
blended
fuel
3


tax
credit.
The
tax
credit
is
multiplied
by
taking
a
constant
4


rate
of
3
cents
multiplied
by
the
number
of
gallons
of
B-2
or
5


higher
sold
and
dispensed.
The
tax
credit
is
due
to
expire
on
6


January
1,
2012.
7


The
bill
eliminates
an
eligibility
requirement
specifying
8


that
the
retail
dealer
of
diesel
fuel
must
sell
and
dispense
9


50
percent
or
more
biodiesel
blended
fuel
during
the
tax
year.
10


It
increases
the
minimum
biodiesel
classification
from
B-2
to
11


B-5.
The
amount
of
the
tax
credit
is
changed
depending
upon
12


the
classification.
The
designated
rate
for
B-5
to
B-9
is
2
13


cents
and
the
designated
rate
for
B-10
to
B-99
is
4
cents.
The
14


tax
credit’s
expiration
date
is
extended
to
January
1,
2015.
15


DIVISION
II
——
BIODIESEL
PRODUCTION
PAYMENT.
The
bill
16


creates
a
program
to
pay
biodiesel
producers
for
production.
17


The
amount
of
the
payment
is
calculated
by
multiplying
a
18


designated
rate
by
the
total
number
of
gallons
of
biodiesel
19


produced
during
each
quarter
of
a
calendar
year,
beginning
20


in
calendar
year
2012
and
ending
in
calendar
year
2014.
The
21


bill
appropriates
moneys
from
the
general
fund
of
the
state
to
22


finance
the
payments.
The
program
terminates
on
January
1,
23


2015.
A
person
fraudulently
claiming
a
payment
in
excess
of
24


the
entitled
amount
of
a
biodiesel
production
payment
is
guilty
25


of
a
serious
misdemeanor.
A
serious
misdemeanor
is
punishable
26


by
confinement
for
no
more
than
one
year
and
a
fine
of
at
least
27


$315
but
not
more
than
$1,875.
