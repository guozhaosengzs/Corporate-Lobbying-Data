EXPLANATION
13


This
bill
replaces
the
current
180-day
school
calendar,
14


which
converts
to
a
required
990
hours
of
instructional
school
15


time
at
5.5
hours
per
day,
with
a
requirement
that
the
school
16


calendar
include
990
hours
of
instructional
time
for
elementary
17


schools
and
1,080
hours
of
instructional
time
for
secondary
18


schools.
The
bill
authorizes
school
districts
and
accredited
19


nonpublic
schools
to
set
the
number
of
days
their
schools
will
20


be
in
session.
21


The
bill
strikes
a
Code
provision
directing
the
state
board
22


of
education
to
define
the
minimum
school
day
and
allowing
the
23


minimum
hours
to
include
early
dismissals
or
late
arrivals
24


for
inclement
weather
or
emergency
health
factors
and
staff
25


development.
However,
the
bill
adds
a
new
requirement
that
26


the
state
board
define
what
constitutes
instructional
time,
27


which
the
bill
states
cannot
include
the
lunch
period,
recess,
28


assembly
time,
late
arrival
or
early
dismissal
times,
or
29


professional
development
time.
30


The
bill
eliminates
a
provision
that
authorizes
a
school
31


district
to
excuse
a
graduating
senior
from
attendance
on
days
32


added
to
the
school
calendar
to
make
up
for
days
lost
due
to
33


inclement
weather.
The
bill
requires
that
graduating
seniors
34


meet
the
same
attendance
requirements
as
those
required
of
any
