EXPLANATION
10


This
bill
creates
an
exception
to
the
statutory
rule
against
11


perpetuities
codified
in
Code
section
558.68,
which
is
a
legal
12


rule
related
to
invalidating
interests
in
property
that
are
13


intended
to
belong
to
a
person
at
some
point
in
the
future,
but
14


for
which
the
actual
determination
of
ownership
cannot
or
will
15


not
be
accomplished
within
a
specified
period
of
time.
The
16


purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
keep
property
from
being
frozen
in
17


trust
beyond
a
certain
period
of
years.
18


The
bill
allows
a
creator
of
a
trust
to
suspend,
explicitly
19


in
the
trust
document,
the
rule
from
applying
to
a
particular
20


trust,
but
only
if
the
trustee
has
the
power
to
sell
all
trust
21


assets
or
if
one
or
more
people,
including
the
trustee,
has
the
22


power
to
terminate
the
trust.
23


The
bill
further
allows
suspension
of
the
rule
in
situations
24


where
an
employer
creates
a
stock
bonus
plan,
pension
plan,
25


disability
or
death
benefit
plan,
or
profit
sharing
plan,
in
26


trust,
for
the
benefit
of
the
employer’s
employees,
for
the
27


purpose
of
distributing
to
the
employees
or
their
beneficiaries
28


earnings
or
principal
or
both.
29


The
bill
applies
to
all
interests
in
real
or
personal
30


property
created
by
testamentary
or
inter
vivos
trust
or
will
31


be
executed
on
or
after
July
1,
2012,
or
to
the
exercise
of
a
32


general
power
of
appointment
created
on
or
after
July
1,
2012.
