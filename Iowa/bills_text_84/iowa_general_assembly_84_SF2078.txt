EXPLANATION
12


This
bill
relates
to
property
taxation
by
allowing
13


adjustments
to
certain
homesteads
based
on
income
limits.
14


The
bill
provides
for
an
adjustment
in
the
assessed
value
of
15


a
homestead
if
the
owner’s
household
income
consists
solely
of
16


payments
received
under
the
federal
Social
Security
Act.
If
17


the
qualification
is
met,
the
assessed
value
of
the
homestead
18


upon
which
property
taxes
are
levied
in
a
fiscal
year
is
the
19


same
assessed
value
as
for
the
previous
fiscal
year.
Assessed
20


value
is
that
value
prior
to
any
rollback
being
applied.
21


The
bill
provides
that
a
person
who
makes
a
false
affidavit
22


for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
an
adjustment,
knowingly
receives
23


the
adjustment
without
being
legally
entitled
to
it,
or
makes
24


claim
for
the
adjustment
in
more
than
one
county
without
being
25


legally
entitled
to
it
is
guilty
of
a
fraudulent
practice
and
26


is
subject
to
a
criminal
penalty.
27


The
bill
applies
retroactively
to
January
1,
2012,
for
28


assessment
years
beginning
on
or
after
that
date
and
applies
to
29


claims
filed
on
or
after
January
1,
2013,
for
the
adjustments.
